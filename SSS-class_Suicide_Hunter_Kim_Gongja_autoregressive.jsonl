{"text": "Because I’m envious. This is how I truly feel. Since I live alone in a single room apartment, I can  honestly admit how envious I am. Because I live alone. Because it’s my space.  "}
{"text": "So, of course, if anyone were to enter my space, they would be shocked. To say the least. Every wall  held countless magazine and newspaper scraps accounting the adventures of the World’s Rank 1  Hunter, the Flame Emperor. Every day, I’m surrounded on all sides by his great legacy.  "}

{"text": "This was history. The Flame Emperor’s history. No. This was Hunter Yoo Sooha’s history that was  recorded long before he received the title, and it surrounded me in all its glory. In this room. With me.  Abhh. I clutched my head, staring at his accomplishments all around me.  "}
{"text": "‘IT want to be successful too! Just like the Flame Emperor!’  I want to be so successful that others would become envious of me. By becoming successful, I would  make an example out of everyone who looked down on me or failed to respect me. After making an  "}

{"text": "Wow. Didn’t I just tell you to not call me by that? I already knew from your trash journalism that your  brain was rotten but were your ears also rotten?  "}

{"text": "The Flame Emperor smirked.  If my advice could make them succeed, they would succeed with anything. If so, what difference will I  make if they’ll succeed anyways?  "}
{"text": "Even so, please say something!  Ah, this is why fucking reporters are really... Fine. Just a few words then.  "}
{"text": "The Flame Emperor scratched the back of his head. His front hair was pulled back and tied with a  rubber band. Was that hairstyle called a ponytail? His black hair, which was long like a horse tail,  shook a bit.  "}
{"text": "Those who will succeed will succeed.  The Flame Emperor glared directly into the camera.  "}
{"text": "But, don’t get in my way even if you succeed. Or I'll kill you.  Excuse me?  That is all. I don’t have anything else to say, so don’t follow me.  "}
{"text": "And it really ended with that. The Flame Emperor left the camera and walked away, alone. The reporter  shouted, “Flame Emperor-nim! Flame Emperor-nim! What do you mean by that?” But he was  completely ignored.  "}
{"text": "I gaped at the Flame Emperor’s back, slowly fading away.  Fuming rage.  I was furious.  "}
{"text": "It was the reporter who was being ignored, but it felt like I was personally being spurned, as well. From  the bottom of my heart, I was boiling mad.  "}
{"text": "“Tf I just had one decent skill,” I said out loud to myself. Yearning was clear in my voice, but I didn’t  care. To wish and to reach for something better was human nature.  "}
{"text": "In reality, I was the lowest F-Class Hunter. I didn’t have such things like making the Internet heated up  —in real time—from an interview. Or having people interested in trivial matters of my private life. Or  most importantly, succeeding with my own skills... and becoming rich. My life was far from such a  successful life. Light-years away, if I was being honest.  "}
{"text": "But I didn’t care about petty semantics right now. What I wanted in this moment wasn’t to highlight  how unattractive my life was. It was my yearning. “I want to succeed,” I said to the walls all around  me. “I want to have an S-Rank skill too.” I considered the Flame Emperor’s bold face and all of the  exclamations telling of his prestige. “And it’s not about the money,” I said. “I just want to succeed.  "}
{"text": "How great would it be if the Flame Emperor’s skill was mine!”  If someone saw my current state, they would probably think I was insane. Obsessive. A freak.  Annoying. After all, I was talking to myself and being quite explicit about my desires. But I’ll say this  "}
{"text": "again. As many times as it takes. This is my single room apartment—my space. And in my room, I will  say it out loud as many times as it takes.  “T want to succeed!”  "}
{"text": "And I’ll continue saying this because venting out my frustration in an empty area is my unique stress  relieving method. It’s really unsightly to see, but who cares? It’s better than going outside and  disturbing others.  "}
{"text": "It’s not like anyone was listening to me.  “... Huh?”  "}
{"text": "But it seemed like I was wrong.  As if someone heard me, a golden light flashed in front of me!  "}
{"text": "“T-Is this...?”  A scene that I’ve only seen from videos. A scene that I’ve rewatched hundreds of times—no, thousands  of times. A scene that fueled my envy every morning because it’s never happened to me.  "}
{"text": "The light that appeared when a Hunter awakened their skill!  And—“It’s a golden light!”  "}
{"text": "Hovering before me. The light I’ve been wanting, needing, and coveting over. It was mine! And it was  a golden light! AGOLDEN LIGHT.  "}
{"text": "At least an S-Rank skill! The golden light only appeared if the skill was at least an S-Rank skill!  My heart pounded like crazy, loud in my ears, as if it wanted to leap out of my chest.  The golden light concentrated in one spot and shaped into a card.  "}
{"text": "| An unsightly envy that is yet to be found in History!  | The Tower, astonished by your unsightly envy, throws you a skill.  Wait... The skill awakening sound was different compared to what I was told.  "}
{"text": "Normally, you would hear something cool like, “The Tower is moved by your determination,” or “The  Tower rewards you for your honest efforts,” or “The Tower praises you for your achievements.”  "}
{"text": "But it threw me a skill because of my unsightly envy? It’s as if the Tower is treating me like a beggar.  ‘N-Nah. Why should I care about its tone when I just received an S-Rank skill?’  "}
{"text": "Unease rose in my chest, but I brushed it aside. How long have I been waiting for this moment? It was  not the time to be concerned with negative thoughts.  | Creating a skill card.  "}
{"text": "The light exploded one last time and a golden card waited before me.  With shaking hands, I grasped the card.  "}
{"text": "I blinked.  "}
{"text": "For a moment, I thought I misread something.  So, once again, I slowly read the last sentence written on the bottom.  However, you die!  "}
{"text": "It really said that. Right there, all in red. Exclamation point. As if the system was laughing at me. At my  ten years of yearning and wishing.  "}
{"text": "If I use this S-Rank skill, I’Il die.  I blankly stared at the card.  "}
{"text": "The wind blew from the open window and shook the scraps of paper glued all over the walls. The  crinkling of the paper tickled my ears. Time passed.  Then I screamed. Everything in me tore out of my throat. “FUUUCK! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!  "}
{"text": "HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO USE THIS SKILL?!”  On this day, I obtained the greatest ever S-Rank skill. [3]  The greatest ever SHIT skill.  "}
{"text": "[T/N]  [1] The Plague (48) is a play on words with the Flame Emperor (&4\\).  "}
{"text": "[2] 4 is an insult that can mean screwing / fucking around or causing trouble.  [3] SCte which translates to all time greatest was simplified to the greatest ever.  "}
{"text": "However, You Die (1)  Translator: Neria  Formatter: Geass606  "}
{"text": "Editor: Nyamh  Skill.  "}
{"text": "A word that reduced many Hunters to tears.  Conditions for awakening a skill vary from person to person:  "}
{"text": "I struck a scarecrow 10,000 times in the training room. Then, it naturally appeared.  One day, I suddenly heard a voice from God!  Magic? I was able to use it soon after entering the Tower.  "}
{"text": "Hunters with good personalities and strong willpower struggled to climb to higher heights because they  lacked skills. In contrast, there were Hunters with dog shit personalities living good lives thanks to their  skills. The Flame Emperor, who represented Rank 1, was the latter.  "}
{"text": "If we compared life to a game, wouldn’t the Flame Emperor be playing a game where luck was a skill?  He could get anything he wanted with his luck skill.  In contrast... my life was comparable to a typical shitty RNG game.  "}
{"text": "I grumbled and heaved as I stumbled along who knew where. Id left the bar after getting shit-wasted,  but I couldn’t remember when that was. I entered an alley and more sludge spewed from my mouth. I  swayed, my eyes focusing on my vomit: I recognized some of the food I’d eaten before.  "}
{"text": "“You are unlucky” is what my vomit seemed to be telling me.  "}
{"text": "“Shit...” I slurred. “If I am supposed to be unlucky, then don’t give me any luck at all. This false hope  has killed me.”  When you play a game, when do you feel despair?  "}
{"text": "Those who have played gacha games on their phones would understand. It is not when you can’t get a  single 5-Star unit after multiple pulls—It’s when you get that 5-Star that just happens to be utter  garbage. A 5-Star that’s worse than a 3-Star.  "}
{"text": "Hell, my 5-Star was worse than a 1-Star.  "}
{"text": "I hurled again but nothing came out except a sob. “Fuck!”  Yeah. My life was truly a shitty RNG game.  "}
{"text": "Normally after awakening a skill, you had to report it to the Hunter Bureau. But I didn’t report it. Like  hell I would. This shit was too depressing. Too embarrassing. Why the hell should I show them such a  trash skill? Like, what would I say or how would it go:  "}
{"text": "“Hello, Hunter-nim,” they would say. “ How did you awaken your skill?”  What could I say? “Uh—I was envious of the Rank 1.”  “Excuse me?” Their faces would distort in confusion.  "}
{"text": "So, just to make it all better, I’d expound further. “I thought I would go insane because of my envy and  jealousy. Then the Tower tossed me a skill like it was telling me to eat this and get lost.” Here was  where I’d flourish my hand as if I was discussing a fine reward I casually got. “It even told me that I’m  "}
{"text": "an ugly person with the greatest envy,” I’d say with a laugh. Haha. Right.  It’s not like I could say that! As if there was any way to tell anyone about this. I alone would laugh and  be miserable at my unlucky, shitty life.  "}
{"text": "So I drank to my heart’s content and ended up wobbling around in a remote alley.  "}
{"text": "Though, nothing had changed—I was still failing. I couldn’t even wobble properly. Without realizing,  I’d staggered into an unknown alley. I couldn’t remember how or when I got here. Where the fuck I  was, that was anyone’s guess.  "}
{"text": "Could I just fall asleep on the floor like this? ‘Ah. This is sad.’ So unlucky. I held back my tears.  A faint scream rose on the night’s air. It came from the other side of the alley.  The pained voice begged, “...please, ugh! Why are you...”  "}
{"text": "Instantly, my drowsiness disappeared.  That voice was too real to be mistaken as a drunken hallucination. While I could not know who it was,  I understood that what was happening was life threatening.  "}
{"text": "‘What’s going on?’ I wondered, treading silently. Instinctively, I held my breath. One step at a time, I  quietly stepped towards the alley where the scream originated.  As I approached, the voices became clearer.  "}
{"text": "This was—  “F-Flame Emperor-nim. Why are you suddenly—” a female voice said.  “—_No use. No one is nearby to—” a male voice said.  "}
{"text": "—This was—the second stupid mistake I made today.  "}
{"text": "The first mistake—drinking until my mind fuse broke. Throughout my entire life, I never got dead  drunk. However, today was an exception. I was extremely furious to find out that my first S-Rank skill  was shit, so I ended up drinking makgeolli like water. [1]  "}
{"text": "My second mistake—not running away as soon as IJ heard the scream.  “T’ve poisoned your drinking cup in advance,” the male voice said. I couldn’t figure out why he  sounded so familiar.  "}
{"text": "“P-poison? Flame Emperor-nim, I can’t understand what you are saying.” Even the woman’s voice. She  sounded altruistic.  "}
{"text": "“Hey, your acting is pretty good. If someone else saw you, they would be fooled.”  A dead end.  "}
{"text": "In the dark alley without any street lights, there was indeed a man and a woman. Perhaps it was weird  to describe them as simply being there. The man was threatening the woman and the woman was being  threatened.  "}
{"text": "“Basilisk’s stomach acid,” the man said. “Originally, you would have poisoned my drinking cup with  this. Wow. If it wasn’t for my skill, I would have been in deep trouble. Hm? What’s wrong? You look  pale, Miss Saintess.”  "}
{"text": "“Ts it the Ten Thousand Poison Immunity (#3 #:7\{<)...? I-impossible! You shouldn’t have such a skill.”  "}
{"text": "“Of course not.” The man laughed, the up and down of it echoing softly. “But I have a skill that’s  slightly better than the Ten Thousand Poison Immunity.”  "}
{"text": "Finally, I realized who this man was. No matter how dark the alley was, I could see the man’s back—I  couldn’t possibly miss that ponytail. I’d seen him and his feats surround me in my room every single  day for the last ten years. And I’d seen him from TV just last night. I’d always wished to be just like  him.  "}
{"text": "‘It is actually the real Flame Emperor!’ I goggled.  The Rank 1 Hunter. The protagonist of this era. An idol who tens of thousands of people looked up to.  "}
{"text": "And because of that, he was the hero who received all the attention and envy... especially my envy.  Additionally, ‘Isn’t she the Saintess! ?’  "}
{"text": "I covered my mouth to hold my breath. The Saintess. A Rank 9 Hunter who was selected by the  Bureau. She is rumored to be dating the Flame Emperor. It was her recent behavior that sparked the  entire scandal. The greatest beauty, who I’ve only seen from Internet photos and videos, was right  there.  "}
{"text": "“But playtime is over,” the Flame Emperor said. “It’s time to pay the price for going against me.”  "}
{"text": "And she wasn’t just standing there. She was being threatened. “W-wait a moment, Flame Emperor-  nim,” she begged. “You must have misunderstood... I only wish to clear the Tower with you as a  team!”  "}
{"text": "“T thought so too, but that wasn’t the case,” the Flame Emperor said.  “Please wait a moment! Think about it. If we team up, we can easily clear up to the 40th floor! We  might even clear up to the 50th floor in a year! That’s right! It’s the place that humanity has not reached  "}
{"text": "yet, but if it’s the two of us—”  “T thought so too, but that wasn’t the case,” he said again.  "}
{"text": "Dumbfounded, I thought, ‘Weren't those two... dating?’ The Internet said so. Even broadcasters  discussed the two heroes’ passionate love. But the scene in front of me had no elements of romance  whatsoever. It was difficult to even joke about it being a lover’s quarrel.  "}
{"text": "Murderous intent (4%).  I only saw a man who wanted to murder and a woman who clung on for dear life.  "}
{"text": "“Please! Let’s just talk to clear up the misunderstanding,” she cried.  “Talk? Ah, talk. Alright. It’s the courteous thing to do.” The Flame Emperor seized the Saintess’ neck.  "}
{"text": "Her voice let out a loud choking noise before her air was completely cut off. After that, only small  groans sounded.  “But, [ll decide the rules and who gets to talk,” he growled.  "}
{"text": "The Saintess struggled as she suffocated. I watched her struggle and I also felt like suffocating.  Unbelievable. Oh my God. Something that shouldn’t be happening was happening in front of me.  "}
{"text": "“T’ll ask the questions. Just answer me. Ah, you don’t need to talk. Simply nod your head to answer.  Okay?”  "}
{"text": "She strove to nod, whimpering. I gulped in fear and sympathy.  “If you answer sincerely, I'll let you live. I’ll even give you the antidote. But if you ignore my personal  consideration... Well, do I need to explain further? I heard you graduated from Oxford. Use your smart  "}
{"text": "head.”  The Saintess desperately attacked the Flame Emperor’s arm latched onto her neck.  "}
{"text": "The sound of her scrambling made its way to my ears but nothing happened. It was impossible for the  the Saintess, who was well known as one of the best healers, to physically win against the Flame  Emperor.  "}
{"text": "“Truthfully speaking, I only have one question for you.”  The Saintess fought for air.  "}
{"text": "“Who commanded you to kill me. Just answer me that. Was it the Black Dragon’s Witch?”  The Saintess flinched and stopped struggling.  “Think carefully before you answer,” the Flame Emperor said. “I might not have Ten Thousand Poison  "}
{"text": "Immunity, but I do have a Lie Detection skill. If you lie to me and I find it out, I’ll burn even your  bones into ashes.”  The Saintess didn’t answer right away. In the dark alley, it was difficult to see her face. However, you  "}
{"text": "could feel her silence. While the Flame Emperor was watching, the Saintess slowly nodded her head.  “T knew it.” His small laughter rose in the air between them. “Goodbye, Saintess Isabelle.”  Flames erupted.  "}
{"text": "The fire swallowed the entire alley. It spread from the Flame Emperor’s grasp to the Saintess’ neck and  then her entire body was engulfed in flames. She started to desperately struggle. It was her last resort to  live. But no matter how hard she floundered against him, she could not escape the Flame Emperor’s  "}
{"text": "grasp.  The Flame Emperor merely gazed at the burning Saintess. Untouched by his own affairs.  "}
{"text": "In front of the scorching flames, the Flame Emperor was calm. Being perfectly calm, he held onto the  Saintess’ neck until the very end. The Saintess swung both of her arms. She dug her nails into the  Flame Emperor’s arm and tried to scratch it. In the end, she reached towards the sky... and stopped  soon after.  "}
{"text": "She went limp.  And she did not move anymore.  "}
{"text": "Emotions roiled in my stomach and smashed into my chest. ‘That crazy bastard!’  "}
{"text": "A hero of humanity died right in front of me. It was wrong to even say she simply died. That’s right-—  her death was not normal.  She was murdered. Murdered by another hero of humanity, the Flame Emperor.  "}
{"text": "‘A madman.’  The Saintess was now just a burnt corpse. Even so, the flames did not stop. The Flame Emperor did not  stop there. He burned everything until her flesh and bones melted. He did so with an emotionless face  "}
{"text": "from beginning to end.  ‘He is not sane.’ I took a step back. ‘I need to leave immediately.’  "}
{"text": "And thus, I made the third mistake of today. My final mistake—  Crunch—  It was a small sound. I didn’t step on a can. Instead, it was a small glass shard.  "}
{"text": "Perhaps it was a glass shard from a shattered soju bottle. [2] Maybe it was carried by the wind from  another place... I didn’t fucking know how it got there. Rather, there was no need to know.  "}
{"text": "Instead, there two things I really needed to understand:  First, I’d made a retarded mistake.  "}
{"text": "“ ..Hoh,” the Flame Emperor’s voice turned towards where I was hiding.  And second, the Flame Emperor was not a predator who would miss out on another person’s mistake.  “T thought I took care of all the rats nearby. I guess one slipped.” His eyes found mine.  "}
{"text": "I ran.  I ran without looking back. Those were the eyes of a murderer. Not someone who killed one or two but  someone who killed tens. Perhaps even more. His eyes were like a fucking demon.  "}
{"text": "And that demon was trying to kill me.  "}
{"text": "“Ha? How cute.” As soon as the Flame Emperor sneered, a hot sensation pierced near my ankle, and in  the next moment, I rolled along the ground. At first, I couldn’t understand how I tripped.  At least not until I saw my legs on the floor.  "}
{"text": "“H-hiik...!2” A screech escaped my lips.  My legs were severed. My legs. Both of them were chopped. Left and right. They were still wearing  shoes, too.  "}
{"text": "I could even see the famous brand logo drawn on the side of the sneakers.  "}
{"text": "“P-please let me live! Please!” I begged. Just like the Saintess.  “Then why did you run? You fucking scared me,” the Flame Emperor said, bending over. He picked up  one of my legs. Then he started playing catch with it like it was a baseball. “Hey. Did you see?” he  "}
{"text": "asked.  My eyes followed the up and down of my leg in the air. To his hands. And then back in the air. “I d-  didn’t see anything!”  "}
{"text": "The Flame Emperor approached closer. “What did you not see?”  “T don’t know anything! Ugh. Please. I don’t know...”  "}
{"text": "“What do you not know?”  “Please... Flame Emperor-nim. Please... let me live. I won’t say anything. I won’t tell anyone.”  I felt his presence above my head.  "}
{"text": "He was bending his knees to look down on me. “Wow. So you’re telling me that you saw me and even  recognized me? You might as well have seen it all. You probably know everything, too.”  "}
{"text": "“Please...”  “Hyung-ssi, you’re disappointing me. [3] Why are you acting like you know nothing?” The Flame  "}
{"text": "Emperor probed my leg. “Tell me. Who sent you? Is it the Black Dragon again?”  “T... really don’t know... anything...”  "}
{"text": "“You’re still telling me that you don’t know anything but happened to watch over me and the Saintess  from there? Silently, like a fucking rat? Hey, now. Hyung-ssi, your story is so reliable. If I was a bit  more retarded, I would have probably believed you.”  "}
{"text": "The Flame Emperor grinned. “But you see, I’m not a retard. Are you fucking mocking me?”  Sparks of fire erupted in front of me. Flames erupted from the Flame Emperor’s palm and it spread  "}
{"text": "onto my legs. The burst of fire eating my legs sounded like a barbecue, the wafting smell of roasting  meat reached my overwhelmed senses.  He burned everything, leaving nothing behind. Not even the famous brand logo. Not even the shoes I’d  "}
{"text": "worn for so long. Not even my legs, which were part of me for even longer.  All of it disappeared.  "}

{"text": "before? You gotta be fucking with me.” Yoo Sooha took out a plastic bottle.  Then he shook it right in front of my eyes. Splash. A blood-red liquid sloshed inside a bottle engraved  with the Ministry of Alchemy’s emblem. Twenty gold from the Ministry of Alchemy. It was a recovery  "}

{"text": "“Wow. Just look at this guy. Your greed is no joke.” Yoo Sooha kneeled so he could look at me on even  ground. “Mister, can’t you tell what’s going on? You’re about to die. Die. This potion is something that  could save your life. And you want to buy your life with just twenty gold? Is your life worth only  twenty gold?”  "}
{"text": "“Right...” I lay there in a pool of “my own” blood.  "}
{"text": "“What if I just leave you here? You would simply die. If you don’t want to die, you gotta pay the right  price for your life.”  Yeah. I knew. “F-forty gold,” I said.  "}
{"text": "“Enough. Hand over everything you have right now.”  I knew that he was this kind of guy.  “Ah, that’s right. You couldn’t give me anything even if you wanted to. You can’t even move your  "}
{"text": "hands, right? Don’t worry. I’ll get it for you. I could do at least that much service.” Yoo Sooha reached  out, rummaged and groped through everything I had: my jacket pocket; the inside of my hoodie; even  my pant pockets.  "}
{"text": "The jerk finally found my leather wallet and smirked. “Let’s see. One gold, two gold, three gold...  Hmm. About sixty gold? You’re so poor, mister. Carry some more around, man.”  "}
{"text": "“That’s all I have...” All I fucking had to my name.  “Tt’s alright. I’ll spend it well on your behalf.” Yoo Sooha took my wallet and patted my head.  4050 days ago, no. He was just like when he burned me alive 4050 days later.  "}
{"text": "“That’s just life, don’t you agree?” He took out something from his chest with a heave, after putting  away the potion he’d promised to give me. Instead, he pulled out a blade. A sword (#').  "}
{"text": "It wasn’t an item meant to save lives. On the contrary, it was a tool used to take lives.  ‘Ha.’ I looked up at Yoo Sooha.

{"text": "was thinking about giving you the potion, mister... But if I let you live here, you might want to get  back at me later, right? I can’t let that happen. A man should live without worry, and since you’ve seen  my face...” Yoo Sooha smiled. “You have to die for me.”  "}
{"text": "The Hunter who I could only ever admire on television. The hero I’d worshipped for 10 years. The man  I’d always envied, always wanted to become. That hero’s face was hideous.  More hideous than I could ever have imagined.  "}

{"text": "While I wasn’t proud of it, there was probably no other human who envied the top ranking hunters as  much as I do. So naturally, I was able to say every name from the 100th to the 2nd in the rankings. All  because of my jealousy.  "}

{"text": "Editor: Ana_Banana  I searched for information about the Sword Saint on my phone.  -Originally, it was said that he was an elder from a wealthy old Northern European Conglomerate.  "}
{"text": "-His real name is Marcus Calenberry. It was rather regretful, but it was said that he gave up his family,  connections and fortune and entered the tower all by himself.  "}
{"text": "-No one knows exactly what skills he has.  -It is rumoured that he has a habit of muttering to himself.  I clicked my tongue.  "}
{"text": "“There’s no helpful information.”  I even looked for any interview videos but couldn’t find a single one. Apparently, this elder was the  "}
{"text": "complete opposite of the Flame Emperor. Although he was reputed for his bad personality, information  of him could be found all over the internet.  On the other hand, the Sword Saint was a mystery.  "}
{"text": "The information on the internet about the Sword Saint was very vague. He was apparently from a large  wealthy family, supposedly entered the tower on his own and it was rumoured that he mumbled to  himself. All the information was speculative.  "}
{"text": "‘What?’  I turned my head to a table in the corner. There, the Sword Saint sat alone, drinking his milk vodka.  ‘At least the information that he talks to himself is correct.’  "}
{"text": "The old man with an odd sense of fashion. Sat at the table with his odd drink and seemed to be  mumbling to himself between sips.  "}
{"text": "“Shut up. Don’t be so noisy. In the first place, you are...”  He mumbled.  "}
{"text": "I couldn’t hear exactly what the old man was saying, but he seemed to spit with every word he said. It  was a horrible scene, and I couldn’t help but be a bit frightened.  ‘Does he suffer from psychosis?’  "}
{"text": "The number one hunter was psychotic. That was scary in itself. It was like having a nuclear bomb and  not knowing when it might explode.  "}
{"text": "‘...No, if you think about it, Yoo Soo-ha had also been a psychopath.’  Perhaps one of the conditions to become number one was to be mentally ill.  "}
{"text": "‘Almost all the top rankers are psychos.’  "}
{"text": "I shook my head and kept browsing the internet for information. However, most of them were purely  speculative. But as I kept looking, a post in a forum caught my eye.  -[Caution! NG1 words you should never say in front of the Sword Saint! ]  "}
{"text": "‘Hmm?’  It was an interesting title. The thread was posted in the Hunter Specialty Community website. A place  to play, chat and share information that could only be accessed by those who had a Bureau issued  "}
{"text": "Hunter Certificate. The post was done anonymously.  -I saw it for myself. There are NG words that you should never say in front of the Sword Saint unless  you want to die!  "}
{"text": "L What are they?  "}
{"text": "L Anything about his family. A few days ago, a few top-ranking hunters were fighting with the Sword  Saint, and one of them said  ‘Looking at the way you are now, your grandchildren outside must have suffered.’  "}
{"text": "‘I bet you like to be alone because they don’t dare keep you around.’  ‘How embarrassed would they be if they saw you behaving like this.’  -Then he died!  "}
{"text": "L What? Died?!  L Yes. He was killed. In fact, he only managed to say, ‘How embarrassed would your grandchildren  "}

{"text": "-Of course, I’m not saying the Sword Saint was wrong. It was that guy’s fault for mentioning his  family. However, it’s certain that those few top powers are ganging up on him because of this incident.  You can see it with the constant abuse directed at him in the media these days.  "}
{"text": "-Anyway, if you ever meet the Sword Saint. You should try it.  “_..-re too loud. I’ll take care of it myself, so leave me alone.”  "}
{"text": "The old man had been muttering to himself since he sat at the table. It really seemed like he had a  mental illness. However, even if he suffered from psychosis, he still stood at the top of the world. The  fact that this crazy old man had great skills beyond imagination remained unchanged.  "}
{"text": "‘Good.’  And that was good enough for me.  "}
{"text": "It was worth giving a shot.  “Good drink.”  “Ah, have a safe trip!”  "}
{"text": "The Sword Saint emptied his goblet.  As soon as he left the tavern, all the customers collectively let out the breaths they had been holding.  “He’s finally gone.”  "}
{"text": "“He must have dementia. Why did he keep muttering like that?”  “T know right. Anyway, the alcohol doesn’t taste good anymore...”  "}
{"text": "All the customers were probably waiting for the Sword Saint to leave, as they all rose to their feet to  leave at the same time as I did.  "}
{"text": "However, our intentions were probably the opposite.  “This is my payment for the beer.”  I got up quickly and settled my bill with the owner. I had no time to waste.  "}
{"text": "“Ah, yes. Thank you. Come again!”  “The beer was delicious. I will.”  Daling!  "}
{"text": "The bell on the door rang as I opened it and stepped out.  It was late at night and darkness covered the street.  "}
{"text": "“Where did you go...?’  I looked around, there were many crowds of people coming out of the numerous pubs on the street.  Dozens of people laughing and staggering as they enjoyed the effects of the alcohol under the night  "}
{"text": "sky.  “Where are you, Mr. First place?”  Fortunately, after looking around for a while, I found the back I wanted.  "}
{"text": "‘Found you!’  "}
{"text": "It was all thanks to his unusual outfit. He was probably the only man in all of Babylon who wore a suit  and carried a sword. I quickly gathered myself and started following the old man.  ‘What skills do you have?’  "}
{"text": "My heart was pounding.  “The Flame Emperor had a ridiculous regression skill which was an Ex-rank skill. So what skills would  the Sword Saint who was the previous generation’s strongest have? Wouldn’t he have skills that were  "}
{"text": "even more broken?’  That skill would soon become mine. If I was lucky. (TL: Our MC is a pretty greedy guy lol, got on EX  skill and now he wants more)  "}
{"text": "How long had I been chasing this old man’s back?  "}
{"text": "We’d long since left the heart of the city and had started walking through the backstreets. As I kept  following him, we left the alleys and backstreets and entered the outskirts of the town. Here, there was  a field that had no buildings or any signs of construction.  "}
{"text": "The Sword Saint walked through this empty field.  “Hmm.”  I walked a bit more before I stopped behind a tree.  "}
{"text": "“This place should be appropriate enough.”  The Sword Saint turned around, with starlight bathing his old body.  "}
{"text": "“Why don’t you come out here young man.”  “No one would know what happened in this place.”  He was staring right at the tree that I hid behind. And I sighed in my heart.  "}
{"text": "‘He caught me.’  I should’ve expected it. From the very beginning, it was unreasonable to think that the strongest hunter  wouldn’t know that he was being followed by a low-class hunter like me.  "}
{"text": "I could only blame my own incompetence as I walked out from behind the tree.  "}
{"text": "“Ah. Excuse me. There is something I wanted to ask you Sword Saint-nim.” (TL: Leaving in ‘nim’ just  to further emphasize just how polite KGJ is being)  I tried to speak as politely as I could. But for some reason, the Sword Saint laughed.  "}
{"text": "“Huh. Weren’t you following me this whole time already? I don’t know why you’re getting so scared to  ask this old man a question.”  "}
{"text": "its ”  Huh?  "}
{"text": "For some reason. It seemed like the Sword Saint believed I was intentionally pretending to be afraid. In  addition, since he’d turned around, the Sword Saint had not let go of the hilt of his sword, even though  I hadn’t done anything. It seemed that he was ready to attack at any moment.  "}
{"text": "‘Uh. Why?’  Of course, this was the best outcome for me, since my purpose was to have him kill me anyway.  ‘But I haven’t done anything other than followed him...’  "}
{"text": "Whether he knew my intentions or not, the Sword Saint seemed as though he was ready to end my life.  As if in his eyes, I was already dead and he was just humouring me.  "}
{"text": "“... Your acting is amazing. Indeed, you must be an amazing assassin.”  To VEST 2”  "}
{"text": "“You don’t need to pretend you don’t know. Other hunters might fall for it, but you cannot fool my  eyes. I know you are an assassin sent by the Black Dragon Guild.”  Uh...  "}
{"text": "Old man, you’re really misunderstanding something.  ‘Should I like this or not?’  Anyway, this way worked too. I didn’t have to talk about his grandchildren for him to kill me. Though I  "}
{"text": "didn’t understand how he mistook an F-class hunter like me for an assassin. Honestly, I couldn’t  understand.  “Uh-huh! You’re really abominable. Come here and act to my face!”  "}
{"text": "The Sword Saint looked at me with his mouth twisted as if staring at a monster he had to get rid of. It  was a very odd expression that I couldn’t understand.  "}
{"text": "“Didn’t I tell you before? You can’t deceive my eyes.”  “This...Sir. There is something I truly want to ask you...”  Eventually, I just asked what I wanted to know.  "}
{"text": "“What makes you so convinced that I’m an assassin? I don’t do anything that would make you think  that.”  "}
{"text": "“Shut up.”  Shing!  The Sword Saint drew the sword at his side.  "}
{"text": "“T have many skills. Among them is a skill that tells me how many people a person has killed. Thanks  to this, I’ve been able to avoid many crises.”  "}
{"text": "What? I still didn’t understand.  ‘Ah.’  Then, a few seconds after, I realized.  "}
{"text": "‘I killed Yoo Soo-ha.’  That’s right.  "}
{"text": "I murdered Yoo Soo-ha today because I knew he was going to become a monster, but the people in this  era didn’t know that. So now I am a murderer.  Unlike the outside world, murders happened pretty frequently inside the tower.  "}
{"text": "‘But murder was still murder.’  In other words, in the eyes of the Sword Saint, there was probably a number [1] hanging above my  head. The number [1] would be a prominent indicator of murder, so it was natural that the Sword Saint  "}
{"text": "was on guard against me.  “Yes, I understand Mr Sword Saint.”  “Hmmm.”  "}
{"text": "“Even if you’re on guard against me and I have nothing to say to that. You can take it as an excuse but  listen. I followed you because of an important reason, I can’t tell you what it is exactly but it is an  extremely important reason. I can swear to the heavens.”  "}
{"text": "It was a heartfelt statement. But the situation became strange instead of getting better. As he listened to  my small speech, the Sword Saint’s expression got worse and worse.  "}
{"text": "“Disgusting.”  “Ves?”  "}
{"text": "“A devil who has murdered as many people as you have dares to act in such a way. I haven’t lived a  clean life, but...I never committed a reckless massacre as you have!”  His words made me confused and embarrassed at the same time.  "}
{"text": "“No. Wait a second. Massacre? I’ve only killed one person in my entire life.”  “You really are shameless to say such a blatant lie!”  Chik!  "}
{"text": "The Sword Saint pointed the tip of his sword toward me and said,  "}
{"text": "“T can see the number [4091] hanging above your head.”  I was dumbfounded.  “What...the fuc...”  "}
{"text": "I tried to ask “What the fuck?” but my words got cut short as I came to the realization of where the  number 4091 came from.  "}
{"text": "‘Ah.’  It was from my one time killing Yoo Soo-ha.  And.  "}
{"text": "‘It’s the number of times I committed suicide.’  4090 times.  The exact amount of times I killed myself.  "}
{"text": "“Be prepared, Devil!”  If so.  "}
{"text": "“T don’t know if it was that Black Dragon Witch who sent you or someone else, but I will do my best to  kill you!”  It meant that in the eyes of that old man, I was nothing but a murderer who slaughtered 4091 human  "}
{"text": "beings. A cold shiver went down my spine.  ‘No.’  "}
{"text": "This was a serious problem.  ‘It was no longer just a matter of copying the Sword Saints skills or not.”  That’s right.  "}
{"text": "‘Anytime in the future...if the Sword Saint sees me, he will try to kill me.’  Because in his eyes, I was an abominable murderer who, like a deadly virus, should not be allowed to  survive in this world.  "}

{"text": "“Please wait a minu...”  At that moment.  "}

{"text": "The clerk who was wearing cat ears bowed toward him, a sunny smile across their face being a bonus.  "}

{"text": "perverted bastard. I can guarantee it.  ‘Is that even important right now?’  "}
{"text": "Of course the clerk didn’t wear the cat ears because they wanted to. They simply didn’t have a choice.  Be it cat ears or a cockroach’s antennae, if the guildmaster told them to wear it, they had to do so.  "}
{"text": "Oh, for reference, this clerk was a man. The uniform was just unisex...  “Excuse me guest but have you confirmed the date? I’m sorry but you can’t win the prize if the ticket  was purchased long before.”  "}
{"text": "“That’s fine. It’s a ticket from last week.”  “That’s great!”  "}
{"text": "It was a lottery ticket that I’d bought right after my discussion with Bae Hu-ryeong. It was because I  intended to win the lottery once anyway, and Bae Hu-ryeong had passionately shouted, ‘You need the  capital!’.  "}
{"text": "“Then we will begin the identification and verification process. Ah, if I may ask, what place did you  win?”  "}
{"text": "“First place.”  “Yes?”  The clerk asked reflexively.  "}
{"text": "“T got first place.”  “Here, please check the number.”  "}
{"text": "Above the head of the clerk hung a billboard. On the billboard the words [The 1st Prize for the  Sangryun Happiness Lottery.] was written, followed by the amount of money that was displayed on  slots like a slot machine in a casino.  "}
{"text": "53,000 gold. If I was to use the currency from my hometown, it would be 5.5 billion won.  -Hey, it’s so easy to make money isn’t it?  The humming voice of Bae Hu-ryeong filled the suddenly quiet hall area.  "}

{"text": "-Will you be okay Zombie? Won't you get stabbed in a dark alley?  “T have an idea.”  I shrugged my shoulders.  "}
{"text": "“Hiding it doesn’t mean that it’ll be hidden.”  All the hunters who won the lottery were recorded. The same was true even for the Flame Emperor. So  everyone could see that he won the first place twice in a row.  "}

{"text": "When I won the lottery I was immediately assassinated. If such a rumor was to spread the one who  would be affected more would be the ones who organized the lottery in the first place.

{"text": "After a while.  “You’ve been waiting for a long time Mr. Kim Gong-ja. My name is Arthur Taylor.”  A man who was dressed more professionally than the previous receptionist appeared and bowed  "}
{"text": "slightly to me. His greeting was very polite. However something that didn’t change was the fact that he  also wore cat ears on his head.  “Call me ‘Vault Keeper’ and I would appreciate it if you spoke to me comfortably.” (TL: In Korean  "}

{"text": "I was only an F class hunter who could only look up to him, the Vault Keeper remained very polite to  me.  -That’s how 50,000 gold customers are treated of course.  "}

{"text": "-Men shouldn't be that easy, man. Be like me. You gotta believe that everything in the world is simply  for your benefit.  "}
{"text": "No matter how I thought about it, Yoo Soo-ha and Bae Hu-ryeong were very similar. They even had  similar nicknames. One was the Flame Emperor and the other was the Sword Emperor. Perhaps all the  people who were called ‘Emperor’ were psychopaths.  "}
{"text": "“Ah, Mr. Kim Gong-ja. I’m sorry, is there something wrong..>?”  The Vault Keeper asked while guiding me up the stairs. He seemed to be afraid that he’d done  something wrong.  "}

{"text": "The Vault Keeper sighed in relief.  “Your expression wasn’t too good so [| thought I’d been rude without my knowledge. Haha. When you  "}
{"text": "said no, I felt so relieved...”  What the. This person...is he an angel?  -Tch. So easy, it’s so easy.  "}
{"text": "I ignored the nagging psychotic ghost behind me. We entered a VIP reception room.  The gold coins were already piled upon the table of the reception room and it seemed that a clerk had  come and prepared it in advance.  "}
{"text": "The Vault Keeper smiled again.  “This is all the coins that customer Kim Gong-ja has won.”  "}
{"text": "“...It’s amazing.”  Over 50,000 coins!  "}
{"text": "The room was bright and it illuminated all the coins at once. Just looking at them made my heart swell.  A feeling was overflowing within me, though I couldn’t really describe what it was. (TL: is...is this  love?)  "}
{"text": "“You can take all of these gold coins, or you can purchase a personal vault from us for safekeeping.  What would you like to do?”  “Well.”  "}
{"text": "I tried to gather my thoughts.  ‘As expected, the magical power of money was great.’  "}
{"text": "Frankly speaking, my mouth was watering. But my goal was to stand on top. To be a handsome hunter  who was the envy of everyone. Money was just a means to reach that goal. (TL: that’s right gong-ja!  ganbatte!)  "}
{"text": "“To be aman who controlled money, not a man controlled by money Kim Gong-ja.’  Regaining my calm, I nodded slowly.  “T’Il keep it in a deposit box.”  "}
{"text": "“Ah. That’s a very wise choice customer!”  The Vault Keeper was delighted.  "}
{"text": "“T always personally suggest this for the winners. I understand wanting to hold all your wealth in your  hands, but I always strongly recommend getting a safety deposit box. After all there are many people  who have bad intentions...”  "}
{"text": "“And.”  I opened my mouth again.  "}
{"text": "“T would like to purchase the status of an honorary member of the Sangryun Guild.”  “Yes?”  “The cost of purchasing an honorary membership is 10,000 gold coins, isn’t it?”  "}
{"text": "I approached the table and rested my hand on the stacks of gold coins.  Gold. The color that dazzled the eyes of man. But I already knew a gold that would be even more  enchanting, my future. For that future, I’d have to invest these gold coins without restraint.  "}
{"text": "“T’Il buy it in a one time payment.”  The Vault Keeper studied my face for a moment.  "}
{"text": "“Customer Kim Gong-ja...you haven’t joined any other guild right?”  “Yes.”  Guild.  "}
{"text": "A hunter guild wasn’t simply for socializing. The greatest significance was instead the [Protection]  given by the guild.  "}
{"text": "Even if it was the Hunter Bureau or a vigilante...  ‘I might get attacked before I could even say anything.’  I could tell from the way the Flame Emperor and the Sword Saint had killed me.  "}
{"text": "Lawlessness. Compared to the world outside, this place was much more brutal.  ‘I shouldn’t foolishly follow the footsteps of the Flame Emperor.’  "}
{"text": "The Flame Emperor had preferred to move alone. After winning the lottery twice, he wouldn’t have had  any protection. It must’ve been a hard and exciting life because many people were after that money.  "}
{"text": "“That’s why he was poisoned and assassinated later on.’  It was very pathetic. Why was there a need to compete with the big guilds?  “ ,.Okay.”  "}
{"text": "The Vault Keeper took out a notebook and began to scribble something.  “Anyone can become an honorary member of our guild for a fixed price. I’1l have an employee  "}
{"text": "immediately come and issue you a second-class honorary membership card.”  “Ah. Oh yeah, and.”  I added a bit more.  "}
{"text": "“T live in a small, cheap apartment right now. I would be really grateful if Sangryun could recommend a  place for me to stay. Of course, I’m willing to pay the necessary price.”  "}
{"text": "oc ”  “In addition, you’ll probably announce the first place winner in the newspaper. At that time, even if you  "}
{"text": "reveal my name, please ensure that they also report my status as an honorary member of the Sangryun  Guild.”  The Vault Keeper wrote all the things I requested in his notebook with a blank expression on his face.  "}
{"text": "(TL: I bet he’s regretting being so polite now hehe)  “You are quite thorough, customer.”  "}
{"text": "“Ugh. With the world as it is nowadays? I need to be prepared for anything.”  “_,.you’re absolutely right.”  Behind the Vault Keeper, Bae Hu-ryeong was holding his stomach and laughing boisterously.  "}
{"text": "-Hey. This expression of his as he’s being treated like this by a pushover. It’s so sweet. This is why I love  making fun of the elite.  "}
{"text": "‘No. You were the one who said I was easy. What’s the big deal?’  -I did? I’m not sure. I don’t quite remember so maybe it didn’t happen.  "}
{"text": "Oh my God. Even if he had to be disgusting, he didn’t need to be this disgusting.  -Anyway, you’re doing a good job on your own.  Bae Hu-ryeong kept laughing.  "}
{"text": "-I was worried that I’d have to clean your diaper and wipe your ass like a baby. But from seeing this, I  think you’ ll be fine.  "}
{"text": "‘If you don’t talk, no one would hate you.’  -Boy, you seem to be in a good mood.  That was right. My mouth was grumbling but my heart was happy.  "}
{"text": "‘Absolutely. It starts from now on.’  4000 deaths to return 4000 days. This was an ability of the regression skill that the Flame Emperor  didn’t take advantage of.  "}

{"text": "We finished our business in the Sangryun headquarters and left. It was right in the middle of the day,  and the streets were bustling. Retired hunters were busily serving customers in restaurants and cafes.  "}
{"text": "There were a lot of completely empty stores among them as well. The owners of the stores were sitting  blankly with their mouths gaped open. People who succeeded would succeed, and those who didn’t  would not. It was cruel, but it was the unchangeable fact of both Babylon and the outside world.  "}
{"text": "—And you just got the tutoring fee. Let’s see, so what’s next?  “Mm. A good tutor?”  "}
{"text": "—Nope. There’s already one in front of you.  Bae Hu-ryeong spoke shamelessly. Without even the slightest change in his expression.  —A good reference book! You need a textbook that’Il help you grow faster.  "}
{"text": "“A textbook...”  —Yeah. Like a skill tome or an elixir. But there’s no way you’ll understand a skill tome even if you get  one, k? So the only answer is to get those fucking expensive elixirs.  "}
{"text": "This guy said the right things in such a rude way.  "}
{"text": "—Also, I don’t deal with cheapo elixirs. Why, was it the Alchemy Castle? There was a guild that doctors  and pharmacists were registered in. Get the elixirs made only by their skilled masters.  “Ek, ”  "}
{"text": "—I know where the store is, so don’t worry. There’s something that grandpops Marcus used to go. If we  get all the elixirs there...  "}
{"text": "“W, Wait a minute.”  —Hm? Why?  "}
{"text": "I lowered my voice because some people were walking by me.  “’,.Aren’t those elixirs ridiculously expensive?  —Of course they’re ridiculously expensive. If you hear the price, your jaw will drop.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong snickered.  —Should I tell you how much it is?  "}
{"text": "“Let’s hear it.”  He whispered in my ear. My eyes widened after hearing the price. It was an astronomical amount.  “Even if I pour everything I have, I only get 4?!”  "}
{"text": "—Heehee. If we buy it in bulk we can get a discount and get 5. They know how to run a business. This is  why doctors who know the taste of money are the scariest.  "}
{"text": "“T, It’s too expensive...”  Goodness. I would become poor again. I thought I would be able to live comfortably since I got the 1st  place lottery ticket.  "}
{"text": "—Well. What can you do about it? It’s because you lack skills. Just think of it all as your fate...humph!  Bae Hu-ryeong’s face hardened.  "}
{"text": "—Gong-ja. Hide.  “What?”  —Quickly.  "}
{"text": "His voice turned serious. I found myself behind a trash can at his words. It was a trash can that a  restaurant used to throw away food waste. I crinkled my nose.  "}
{"text": "“Why are you telling me to hide suddenly?”  —Be careful. It’s grandpops Marcus.  "}
{"text": "ts ”  I held my breath. Carefully, I peeked above the trashcan to see the street. An old man with tied back  white hair, the current world Rank 1 with the Detective’s Insight, Sword Saint, was walking far away.  "}
{"text": "‘If I get caught it’ suck.’  "}
{"text": "My heart pounded. Was it because my nervousness was delivered. Too much talker Bae Hu-ryeong shut  his mouth for a while. Both of us hid behind the trash can holding our breaths, looking at Sword Saint.  “,.Again...shut up...”  "}
{"text": "Thankfully, he didn’t seem to have noticed us. He muttered to himself like always and headed  somewhere.  "}
{"text": "—Sheesh.  Bae Hu-ryeong grimaced seeing Sword Saint enter some building.  —Tsk! That’s the best shop.  "}
{"text": "“The best shop?”  —Elixirs, I’m talking about elixirs. The best creator set up their shop there. Ugh, seriously! Everyone  "}

{"text": "I was overflowing with luck.  “Tt might not cost as much as I thought.”  —What?  "}
{"text": "“We’ll only have to spend a penny to get the best elixir.”  I grinned.  "}
{"text": "“Cause I know a really good pharmacist.”  We entered a dark alley.  "}
{"text": "It was a poor neighborhood. People here had to live here because they couldn’t earn money. It was a  harlem neighborhood. The hunters looking our way had abnormal gazes in their eyes.  —...There’s a skilled pharmacist here?  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong complained, like he didn’t believe it.  “Tt’s not a skilled pharmacist, but the best pharmacist in history.”  —Take it easy with your lies. Why would someone like that stay here?  "}
{"text": "“Ah, don’t believe me if you don’t want to.”  I heard someone clicking their tongue from some comer. It seemed like the hunters looking our way  had turned away. They probably thought I was a psycho seeing me talk to myself. Even though people  "}
{"text": "in this harlem were the worst, they didn’t touch mental patients. I smirked to myself.  ‘What’s gonna happen if they know my wallet’s filled with gold coins?’  It was obvious. They would run at me like wolves.  "}
{"text": "Of course, I didn’t plan on telling my wallet’s business to others. Smelling the scent of rotting corpses,  I entered deeper into the alley. It was then that I heard the sound of something ripping.  "}
{"text": "“P, Please, just don’t touch my experiment materials!”  A young voice.  "}
{"text": "After that, someone spoke in a rough tone.  “You’ve done this more than once now? What kind of bullshit are you spitting out!”  “Tt’s already half a year since the due date. You have to pay the price now.”  "}
{"text": "I headed towards where I heard the voices. In the middle of the twisted streets, there was a empty store  set up. It was where the people were fighting.  "}
{"text": "“Ut. I, If you take all the tools...I really can’t make a living...”  “Let’s go, there’s nothing to see anymore. Take everything!”  Gangsters with good bodies got machines onto their rearcars. A young woman looking to be in her mid  "}
{"text": "20s grabbed onto them to plead.  “One week! Please just give me one more week. No, 5 more days...”  “That one week became one month and that month became half a year now!”  "}
{"text": "As the gangsters drove away, the store owner collapsed to the floor without being able to protest. She  held her hand out to the rearcars even when her knees were being scratched.  "}
{"text": "“There’s...there’s still incomplete liquid medicine...!”  “Ugh. Why did we get caught by this crazy pharmacist. Lady! I’m advising you, but don’t ever make  "}

{"text": "Including me, all the other neighborhood people had come out to watch. They whispered amongst  themselves.  "}
{"text": "“Tsk tsk. I thought that store would fail.”  “The medicine is too expensive. Why is a single health potion 40 Gold?”  “She thought business was easy because she’s young...”  "}
{"text": "Perhaps she had heard the whispers of the onlookers. The despairing store owner whipped her head  towards them.  "}
{"text": "“E, Expensive? I only sell it at the original price!”  She looked quite pitiful. Her hair was stuck to her head like she hadn’t washed it in days. The glasses  on her face looked like antiques. Even her voice was cracky.  "}
{"text": "“Only our store sells these kinds of medicines at this price in Babylon! Y, You should actually be  grateful that I set up my store here! Yeah!”  "}
{"text": "“Aw, she’s still not living in reality.”  “Sheesh. Does she think she’s better to say that...”  "}
{"text": "The onlookers shook their heads and the crowd dispersed.  The store owner who looked like no one would like her was still there.  "}
{"text": "“Oh...W, Wait. Since you’re all here, how about a bottle of health potion... With my special potion,  even an almost dead hunter can flop back to life.”  “T. | won’t buy it, I won’t.!”  "}
{"text": "She tried to grab onto the onlookers, but it was too late. The water was already spilled. They cursed and  disappeared.  "}
{"text": "“Tt has really good effects...it’s not a lie...”  She plopped on the ground.  "}
{"text": "—Hey.  Bae Hu-ryeong muttered after seeing that unpleasant scene.  —Is the ‘historical pharmacist’ you talked about...that loser?  “What are you going to do if it is?  "}

{"text": "since she was wearing a white coat, you could tell she was a pharmacist and not a beggar.  “Store owner-nim. You’re still selling, right?” [TN:Store owner-nim is a way to address store owners  respectfully in Korean. ]  "}

{"text": "The color came back to her face. Her store had been on the brink of going bankrupt, but there was a  customer saying they would buy expensive medicine.  “Uh, but how expensive are you talking about...?”  "}
{"text": "“Hm.”  In the future, she was a pharmacist that I couldn’t even think about buying from, but this time was  different.  "}
{"text": "“T want to buy about 20,000 Gold worth.”  She dropped her mouth open.  "}
{"text": "So what if she looked pathetic. To me, she looked like a goose that laid golden eggs. And 100% percent  pure gold ones at that!  "}

{"text": "now, she is going to be in the highest position of Alchemy Castle 10 years later.”  Bae Hu-ryeong shut his mouth.  "}
{"text": "-You just cursed me in your mind, huh?  “This ghost is trying to hurt an innocent person now.”  I pretended not to know what he was talking about. He was uselessly too quick for his own good.  "}
{"text": "5.  4 days quickly passed.  "}
{"text": "During that time, the pharmacist continued to take away money from my safe. Someone came from  Sangryung to ask if it was really alright, but I told them to let her be. Even if it cost a lot of money, if it  was for medicine made by the Lord of Alchemy Castle, it was nothing.  "}
{"text": "—Zombie. Wanna bet?  “Geez, what this time.”  -That lady’s gonna run away with the money. I guarantee it. I don’t know about anything else, but my  "}

{"text": "On lunchtime of the 4th day.  The pharmacist came to my room carrying the elixirs herself.  "}
{"text": "“S, Sorry. I wanted to give it to you faster, but it took longer than I thought...”  “Tt’s fine. You said you would make it in 4 days anyway. That’s good.”  The pharmacist bought 3 boxes of elixirs.  "}
{"text": "If I drank it 3 times per day, it would last for 30 days.  If we went to the store Bae Hu-ryeong wanted to go to, we would only get 2 days worth. This was an  increase by 15 times.  "}
{"text": "‘And the effects are probably better.’  This was how you should spend money.  I subconsciously smiled.  "}
{"text": "“Um...”  “Yes?”  "}
{"text": "“T, I know it’s weird asking this now. But why did you leave such an expensive order to me?”  She twisted her fingers.  "}
{"text": "“O, Of course, I’m confident in myself. Looking at the recipe, I think there’s only about 2 people in  Babylon who can make this...But, people only treat me like a freak.”  "}
{"text": "“Hm.”  The reason why I left it to this person.  "}
{"text": "It was because this person was the genius of the century. The guild master of the Alchemy Castle. I had  calculated to have some connection to the person who would grow to be the master of a large clan  someday.  "}
{"text": "However.  ‘That’s not all.’  Before I regressed to 4000 days before.  "}
{"text": "When the Flame Emperor had set fire to the slums. At the time, someone had arrived before anyone  else to control the fire even though she was one of the highest rankers. Helping the people, Lord of  Alchemy Castle had muttered.  "}
{"text": "-That Flame Emperor, I don’t like him.  -He gives me bad vibes or something...talking about someone’s back here isn’t nice,but I still think  Saintess could meet someone better.  "}
{"text": "Someone who had seen Flame Emperor’s real self.  ‘She probably just guessed it with her senses without any evidence.’  Even if that was the case, she had the outstanding ability of reading people.  "}
{"text": "She was skilled, nice enough to run immediately to help people in danger, and could read psychopaths.  Wouldn’t it be a waste not to be close with this kind of person?  "}
{"text": "I opened my mouth.  “Because you seem nice.”  “What?”  "}
{"text": "“T helped you because you seemed nice. Well, you probably would’ve made it big even if I didn’t help  you. But shouldn’t kind hunters like us help each other to grow?”  "}
{"text": "oc ”  “We can’t let psychopaths be the only ones to succeed. That’s unfair. Store owner-nim and I should  work harder.”  "}
{"text": "I said exactly what I felt without telling any lies. I couldn’t be more honest than this. Now, it depended  on how the other person accepted my words. She stared at my face and spoke.  "}
{"text": "“_..] see. Yes. Since we have to succeed first to change the world.”  It was a determined tone.  "}
{"text": "“Thank you, customer-nim! As you said, I’ll work harder too!”  Her fist was clenched.  "}
{"text": "“If you have anything more to order, contact me! I’ Il always prioritize your orders!”  “T’ll be grateful for that.”  We both smiled at each other and turned away.  "}
{"text": "Unfortunately, my smile didn’t last for long.  -Hoho. I haven’t seen a hunter who called himself nice in a while. And I’ve never seen someone accept  it like that. Hey, are you guys crazy? Tsk tsk tsk. You’re not in your right mind.  "}
{"text": "“_..] know I said something embarrassing so let’s just start training.”  The next day.  We headed towards the hunting ground. I took a sleeping bag and plenty of elixirs in my backpack.  "}
{"text": "If there was something different than normal, it was that I was on the 3rd floor hunting ground and not  the 2nd floor.  "}
{"text": "There were lots of monsters that were still too much for me to deal with. Orcs and goblin hordes  hovered around. I looked at them from far away.  "}
{"text": "“What do I do from now?”  -Drink your elixir first.  I nodded my head.  "}
{"text": "I gulped down the elixir that was the tumbler I brought without any hesitation.  “Mm.”  The taste itself was normal.  "}
{"text": "It tasted good, like honey and lemon were added to it.  The moment I thought it was a relief that it tasted good.  "}
{"text": "Thump.  My heart beat faster than normal.  "}
{"text": "At first, I thought I was hallucinating, but I wasn’t. Sweat dripped down my back. The most interesting  fact was that...I could feel each and every drop of sweat on my back clearly.  "}
{"text": "‘What is this?’  Thump.  "}
{"text": "It wasn’t just the sweat. The touch of the air on my fingers and the feeling of the ground I was stepping  on. When I blinked it felt like 30 seconds.  "}
{"text": "“This...is...”  -Effects of the elixir.  Only Bae Hu-ryeong’s voice felt the same amongst everything that felt different.  "}
{"text": "-It slows down what you feel. It’s easy if you think that it extends your time. I don’t want to admit it, but  that lady is pretty good at making elixirs.  It was horrible.  "}
{"text": "I could feel each strand of hair moving on my body. I could even feel the veins in my ears twitching. If  I didn’t know, I would think that I drank poison, and not an elixir.  "}
{"text": "-Can’t you feel it?  “What...are...you....talking...about?”  "}
{"text": "-The thing moving in your heart.  Thump.  There was something there. No, something was flowing. And it wasn’t blood.  "}
{"text": "It was softer and more frail than blood. But it definitely flowed in my entire body. It was slowly  spreading from my heart. Something that I had never felt before.  "}
{"text": "-That’s Aura.  Bae Hu-ryeong spoke.  "}
{"text": "-All hunters in the Tower have Aura in their bodies. They just live not knowing it. How much you’re  able to feel this Aura and control it is what determines victory.  Bae Hu-ryeong laughed.  "}
{"text": "The laughter lasted for 20 seconds. It was probably only a short second, but somehow, it felt like 20  seconds to me.  "}
{"text": "I felt tired, like I would fall over if I just let go.  -Usually, you get used to this feeling by quietly training by yourself.  Inside of it. Something big approached.  "}
{"text": "-But that’ll take too long.  Boom.  "}
{"text": "Footsteps.  Even the footsteps seemed long to me. When I lifted my head to see, a big orc was heading towards  me.  "}
{"text": "-A talentless body like you has to suffer a bit.  This damned.  "}
{"text": "-Alright! If you don’t want to be hurt, use your Aura, Kim Zombie! You have to train with real things!  You’re not gonna kick the bucket anyway, so what if you get a little hurt.  "}
{"text": "“This...ghost...really...!”  -Hm? I can’t hear what you’re saying because you’re a loser who can’t even use Aura.  He burst into laughter again.  "}
{"text": "—Are you in anguish? Kill yourself if you don’t like it. Oh, then your kill count increases from 4000.  Then grandpops Marcus will hunt you over and over again, huh?  Ah.  "}

{"text": "-Roarrrrr!  The orc bellowed.  It could’ve been a short growl and not a bellow. But to me, it sounded like a long echo. 50 seconds! In  "}
{"text": "that time of about 1 minute, the sound of the orc rang in my ear.  “Ke, uk...!”  "}
{"text": "It was a head-splitting pain.  -Hey. Focus.  Bae Hu-ryeong was ever the same in that slowed down time.  "}
{"text": "-Don’t get scared by something like an orc! Orcs are just ridiculously strong, their attack patterns are  simple. If you can tell where they’Il attack, you can easily avoid them and fight back. It’s a fucking  piece of cake.  "}
{"text": "“That’s easier...said...than done!”  -He’s coming.  "}
{"text": "The orc swung his club around. No, he was swinging it. It slowly but surely approached my head. If I  stayed still, my head would explode.  “Sh, it!”  "}
{"text": "I jumped to the side with all my strength. But my body didn’t follow my command.  ‘I’m slower!’  Just one step. I could avoid the attack with just one step, but that one step was too slow. I felt frustrated.  "}
{"text": "I was so frustrated I felt like crying. I could avoid it! I even knew where it would attack!  -You can avoid it. Don’t give up.  Bae Hu-ryeong spoke in a low voice.  "}
{"text": "-Focus your Aura on your feet. Amplify your senses! Like the flow in your heart is being sent to you  right foot, quick!  "}
{"text": "Damn.  ‘He’s a ghost but his mouth is blabbering like it’s alive!’  "}
{"text": "For the first time in my life, I felt what Aura was. How would I focus this on my leg? It was really  easier said than done. But...there was no other way. I had to do something. Even if I wasn’t scared of  dying, I didn’t want my head to fall off because of the orc’s club!  "}
{"text": "‘Move!’  The flow in my heart. It felt cool and clean, like a flowing stream. I focused on that cool feeling and  tried to send it down to my right leg.  "}
{"text": "Squirm.  The Aura in my heart twitched with my efforts but-  "}
{"text": "-It’s harder than you think, huh?  It was hard.  "}
{"text": "-It’s because there’s no pathway for Aura in your body yet. The path hasn’t been made! Your body can  be compared to a mountain road. You need to clear it like a highway to be able to use it.  “Hup...!”  "}
{"text": "I continued to focus on my right leg while Bae Hu-ryeong babbled on. If my heart was a blocked sink,  my right leg was like a cup under it. Drip. Drip. Aura slowly dripped off of the broken sink.  "}
{"text": "-You’re able to feel it because you ate the elixir. Under normal circumstances, it’s impossible. Tsk. That  lady’s cleanliness is disgusting but her skills are definite.  "}
{"text": "The club whooshed close by me. I could feel the wind when it went by. The wind collided with my skin  and dispersed. 1 second. No, if I was late by 0.5 seconds, my body would’ ve been destroyed by that  club.  "}
{"text": "“W, What...”  Relief only lasted for a moment.  “Happens...?”  "}
{"text": "The orc grunted. He probably didn’t like this. The fact that a weak looking prey like me had dared to  escape his attack. He immediately raised his club again.  This time, it was a horizontal attack to break my back.  "}
{"text": "There wasn’t any time to rest.  I focused my Aura on my upper body.  -Hm? What happens what?  "}
{"text": "“Tf...make...a mountain path...into a highway...!”  It was hard. The sink in my heart was still clogged up. I didn’t see water flowing from it anytime too. I  "}
{"text": "was thirsty, but it was only releasing one drop at a time.  ‘I don’t want to admit it but Bae Hu-ryeong is right.’  A mountain path without anything around it.  "}
{"text": "It was a perfect metaphor that described me.  So I was curious.  "}
{"text": "If I could leave this level.  If I could escape.  “After...what...happens!”  -He.  "}
{"text": "He smirked.  -You. When grandpops Marcus killed you, your neck was cut without even a chance to fight back,  "}
{"text": "right?  Yes.  "}
{"text": "I remembered the view of the night sky and the crescent moon.  Bae Hu-ryeong’s words dug into my brain.  -You can think of that as a clean street.  "}
{"text": "A clean street.  That beautiful attack was just. Was just a clean street.  "}
{"text": "-Even grandpops Marcus has a long way to go. And you, let’s not even talk about you. Zombie. I’m not  nagging you because my personality is like trash, it’s because you’re worth being nagged. Heehee.  I clenched my teeth.  "}
{"text": "-Mm?  Obstinance grew inside me.  “Hup...!”  "}
{"text": "I bent over. Whoosh! The orc’s club swung into the air above my back. It was close. I barely avoided  the second attack after the first one. And I didn’t plan on letting it get in another attack.  "}
{"text": "-What?  I gathered strength in my knees.  -Look at you.  "}
{"text": "I focused my Aura on my feet. Not just focus it, but bend it. 5 seconds. 3 seconds. 1 second. It was  messy, but when Aura gathered at my feet, I jumped up with all my strength.  "}
{"text": "I lifted my sword.  The target was the orc’s Adam’s apple!  -Gwo?  "}
{"text": "He looked down at me confusedly. I saw my reflection in his eyes, and the sword that was in my hands.  My sword became bigger in his eyes. In an instant, my sword cut his throat and the orc’s face crumpled  in pain.  "}
{"text": "-Kraaaaaa!  Until the evening sky. In the large hunting ground, a scream rang out.  "}
{"text": "When I thought it was finished.  -Don’t let your defenses down until the end!  Bae Hu-ryeong shouted.  "}
{"text": "-The skin of an orc’s skin is tough! Fix your Aura on your blade! No, that’s probably too hard. Just hit  it like your smashing it!  "}
{"text": "And so I did.  The orc’s scream became more violent. I squeezed out every drop of Aura in my heart that I could and  "}
{"text": "used it to smash my sword down. Every time I brought it down, the monster’s scream became more  pained.  -Kwo, ga...krirr...!  "}
{"text": "Blood splattered everywhere. The blood of the orc covered my face in slow motion. I didn’t avoid it. I  didn’t even blink. It was to save every last bit of Aura for the sword.  "}
{"text": "“Di, e...!”  In a short moment.  "}
{"text": "I felt the sword pierce the orc’s skin all the way to the opposite side.  -Gririr...1T...  He stumbled.  "}
{"text": "Even the time that he stumbled was long. He slowly fell backwards. I didn’t let go of my sword, so  when the monster fell, I fell with him.  "}
{"text": "“Hu...k, uk...! Hup...!”  I panted looking at the orc’s corpse.  It wasn’t just the tired breathing.  "}
{"text": "A moment later, my entire body became pained. The world spun. It really felt my entire body was  going to rip apart.  “Uuk...?!”  "}
{"text": "-Does it hurt? It hurts, right? Yup. It’ll fucking hurt.  Bae Hu-ryeong smirked at me while flying around me.  "}
{"text": "-Since you used your Aura when your pathway wasn‘ cleared yet. There’s no way your weak body  could take it! Sucks to be you.  "}
{"text": "“Y, You....”  -Ah. But it was nice seeing you bending your Aura at the end. Good job. I’ll compliment you. You have  to be creative when you use Aura. A lot of people are misled, but the smarter you are the better you  "}
{"text": "fight.  I wasn’t curious about those things right now.  "}
{"text": "“Hee, huk...keuk...!”  This pain!  "}
{"text": "A pain like my bones were being crushed and my veins were exploding. My only interest was how to  quiet this feeling. Usually, it would pass with time, but because my time was extended, that wasn’t an  option. It just hurt. It still hurt.  "}
{"text": "I felt like I was going to die.  -Does it hurt like you’re going to die?  “Can’t you...see...”  "}
{"text": "-Then you’ll feel better if you really die.  What?  -People who force their Aura usually become half disabled. This can’t be fixed with potions. So right  "}
{"text": "now, you just made yourself disabled to catch an orc.  “W, What...”  "}
{"text": "-I told you, Zombie. If you didn’t have the regressing skill I shouldn’t have suggested this kind of  training. Grandpops Marcus eats elixirs too but he trains by himself. He doesn’t stupidly attack  monsters like you.  "}
{"text": "This ghost bastard?  -But you return even if you die. It’s the freaking best! Even with extreme training, your body is fine.  "}
{"text": "Wow, I’m jealous. How nice would it have been if I had a regressing skill like you!  Wow.  How could he be so spiteful?  "}
{"text": "Did this guy have a passive skill like [Son of a Bitch] or [Impudent Manner]? That would explain his  trashy personality.  "}
{"text": "-Zombie. But if you kill yourself, your kill count increases again.  “And...so?”  "}
{"text": "-There’s no need to raise your kill count from here. And it’s dangerous if you get caught by grandpops  Marcus.  "}
{"text": "A worrisome sound came from behind. It was something I heard before not too long ago. I looked back,  and my bad feeling was right. A monster that looked like the orc that just fell was drooling behind me.  "}
{"text": "“Da...mn.”  The monster was the same but my condition wasn’t the same. As Bae Hu-ryeong said, my body was  half disabled now. Even lifting a finger was painful.  "}
{"text": "-It’s ok! There’s a lot of players who can’t understand Aura their entire lives, and you somewhat got it  just by taking the elixir. If this keeps up, 100 deaths should be more than enough. Step by step.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong sniggered.  -Let’s go Zombie! 1 death coming up!  "}
{"text": "At the same time, the orc’s club started to come down. Slowly. Targeting my head. Looking at the club  right in front of my nose, I opened my mouth.  errs) 1 me  "}
{"text": "Have you ever felt your nose break, and then feel your brain explode into two right after that?  You probably haven’t. That’s a relief. Because it’s really not a good feeling.  If there was a silver lining, it was probably that I heard the voice right after my brain exploded.  "}
{"text": "[You have died. ]  My world returned to normal.  To be precise, my sense of time returned.  "}
{"text": "‘Whew...’  A pitch black area.  "}
{"text": "The space where I stayed until my next regression.  In the place that I was somewhat used to...someone that I didn’t like was floating around.  -Hm?  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong.  -Dang. What’s this?  "}
{"text": "‘...somewhere I stay after dying. I picked my skill cards here when I was killed my Flame Emperor  and Sword Saint. Well, I’m calling it Nether World for now.’  -Fucking cool.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong spun around the dark space.  "}
{"text": "-But Zombie. Why am I here?  ‘Why would I know? It’s probably because you’re on me now.”  I sighed.  "}
{"text": "‘If we wait like this, I’ll regress with a voice that tells me I’ll return to 24 hours before. Oh right. I’m  curious if you also...’  It was the moment I was going to say I was curious if he would regress with me.  "}
{"text": "[The skill condition has been achieved due to death. ]  [The monster orc’s skill is being randomly copied. ]  *...Huh?’  "}
{"text": "-What?  Bae Hu-ryeong and I stopped at the same time. We both turned to look at each other. Bae Hu-ryeong  "}
{"text": "looked baffled, and my face probably had a similar expression.  [Skill cards are being created. ]  "}
{"text": "Two bronze colored skills popped out from the darkness.  I stupidly mumbled to myself looking at them.  ‘...Monsters had skills too?’  And Bae Hu-ryeong shouted.  "}
{"text": "-What is this? It’s a fucking cheat skill!  "}

{"text": "Chapter 14 — You Have a Skill Too? (2)  Translator: HH  "}
{"text": "The voice continued to speak regardless of the blabbering ghost.  [Please select a skill card. ]  This was real!  "}
{"text": "Two orange bronze cards started to fly. They began to speed around me enough to make me dizzy, but  my mind was one something else.  -Shit. What kind of cheat is this! Getting to copy all the monsters’ skills as well is unfair. Hey. Who’s the  "}
{"text": "person that manages this Tower! Why didn’t you give this skill to me and to this lame-ass kid instead!’  ‘Ah. Let’s be quiet now.’  -Come out, you tower! This doesn’t count. Ahh, my anger!  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong whipped his arms and legs around in fury. It was...just hideous. He was no different  from a child that was angry because their candy was stolen. He was so hideous that it was a wonder he  could be that hideous.  "}
{"text": "‘Sheesh. I should just focus on my cards.’  I observed the two cards flying in the air.  ‘Both of them are poop-colored cards so it’s not gonna be a good skill, but...’  "}
{"text": "But my heart pumped. Goodness. The skill of a monster. I could share the same skill as a monster! I felt  like I had done something covert, like I played a prank on someone.  "}
{"text": "‘I’m curious.’  I stretched my hand out.  "}
{"text": "‘Let’s just pick one of them!’  And it was then, when I was just trying to grab any one of them.  -Huh? You’re getting that?  "}
{"text": "The ghost bastard couldn’t stay out of it and interfered again. My excitement faded away. Geez. His  ability to bring someone down was really amazing.  "}
{"text": "“Yes. It doesn’t matter which one I pick anyway.’  -Why doesn ‘*t it matter?  Bae Hu-ryeong looked at me past the cards.  "}
{"text": "-Since you’re getting a free ride anyway, you should get a good skill while you’re at it.  ‘I can’t tell which is the better skill. They’re both poop-colored. This is just a game of luck.’  "}
{"text": "-What? How come you can‘ tell which is the better skill?’  ‘Geez. You’re especially bad at understanding today.’  I shouted in frustration.  "}
{"text": "‘The colors of the cards are the same! I can only see their backs! There’s no way to tell between them,  so how should I know which one’s the better one.’  "}
{"text": "Then Bae Hu-ryeong tilted his head.  -But I can see it?  "}
{"text": "‘What?’  -I can see the front of the cards.  Bae Hu-ryeong spoke in a shameless voice. I was stunned into silence.  "}
{"text": "‘What kind of bullshit...’  Is that, is what I was going to say, but I realized in the middle of my sentence.  Location!  "}
{"text": "From my location, I could only see the back of the card. Even when I tried to look around, the cards  looked the same. Like how you couldn’t tell which was the back of the moon on Earth, I could never  see what was on the back of the card.  "}
{"text": "But that was just me.  Bae Hu-ryeong moved as he wished in this dark space.  "}
{"text": "Yeah.  He could move to where he saw the cards!  "}
{"text": "‘Goodness...’  I muttered.  ‘Can you really see it there? Can you see the card summary?’  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong furrowed his eyebrows.  -Of course I can see it. What are you saying, looking at my eyes. I was famous for having good eyesight  since I was young. There was a guy called Dog Poop in my village, right? So he shot a firecracker at  "}

{"text": "-Fuck! Did this kid go crazy! Why are you screaming?  Bae Hu-ryeong was surprised but I didn’t care.  "}
{"text": "‘Eureka! Eureka! Eurekaaaaaaa!’  I was just happy at the luck that came my way.  "}

{"text": "-What? Hunter’s Association? We never had those guys in my world!  I meant to say that I was the only calm one.  "}

{"text": "“My girlfriend died 1 year ago. Some time ago, the Alchemy Castle said I have a terminal illness. Even  if I live, it’ll only be half a year, and I don’t have the confidence to endure that half year without my  girlfriend.”  "}
{"text": "“Ah...”  -What?  Bae Hu-ryeong grimaced.  "}
{"text": "-What kind of shit is this zombie guy saying ?  I ignored him. And I continued whispering to the doorkeeper.  "}
{"text": "“But even if I’m a lowly ranker, I’m still a hunter. I don’t want to enter the Alchemy Castle’s hospital  wondering when I’ll die. Even if I die... want to challenge a monster until the very end.”  "}
{"text": "“You had that kind of...”  He had a pitiful face looking at me. You know. The face people make when they listen to others  misfortunes.  "}
{"text": "“This is money I collected from fights.”  I handed the pouch to the doorkeeper. There was 100 Gold inside.  "}
{"text": "“T don’t have anywhere to use it anyway...you can have it.”  “T, I can’t accept this money!”  "}
{"text": "“T want to lightly leave the world, door keeper-nim. And please don’t write down that I entered here.  It’s the last request of my hunter life...”  His face turned heavy, like he was going to cry. And a bit of that heaviness was probably from that  "}

{"text": "I was smiling.  “Tt honestly feels great.”  "}
{"text": "It was something I had never felt in my entire life. But I knew what feeling this was without anyone  telling me. I instinctively knew.  "}
{"text": "It was the feeling of being at the top.  “T feel like I’m on top of the world.”  -Right?  Bae Hu-ryeong smirked.  "}
{"text": "-That’s nothing more than an illusion. You’re not on top, and you only subjugated the 10th floor. But it’s  not 100% an illusion. Kim Gong-ja. You’re closer to the top than anyone else in your world.  "}

{"text": "I smiled.  “What are you going to do about it if I really cleared it?”  “Excuse me?”  "}
{"text": "“T asked what you’re going to do if I’m really the hunter who cleared the 10th floor.”  “1, That’s:..”  The doorkeeper had a flustered face.  "}

{"text": "“Work hard. Ah, and don’t follow me. Or I’ Il really run away.”  Thankfully, the doorkeeper didn’t follow after me. Even if he did, it didn’t matter. I could easily lose  him since he was tired from the stairs.  "}
{"text": "-Hey. His face is a sight to see. It’s like he saw a ghost.  Bae Hu-ryeong snickered looking behind him.  "}

{"text": "“Why you suddenly complimented me.”  I reserved the one heading down to the 1st floor and spoke.  “The bet.”  "}

{"text": "-...what.  "}
{"text": "“Ah. Now I can hear you. I thought you were deaf now. Tsk tsk, you made the superior Gong-ja-nim  worry. Humans shouldn’t do that.”  “Ah, right. You’re a ghost, not a human. I’m stupid, so I forgot. Oh right! Sword Emperor. Can I speak  "}

{"text": "“Mm?”  A brown cat crawled up to me. It was too clean to be a stray. If there was something special about it, it  "}
{"text": "was that there were two gold pieces on its neck instead of a bell.  Gulp.  I wondered how I should deal with this situation.  "}
{"text": "‘Gold Piece Cat.’  "}

{"text": "I calmly looked down at the cat. Controlling my face.  “Are you lost?’  "}
{"text": "-Meow.  The brown cat rubbed its head on my legs. I was a bit dumbfounded. If I didn’t know its real identity, I  would just think it was a friendly cat.  "}
{"text": "“Do you wanna stay with me until your owner comes?”  y' y  -Meoooow.  "}
{"text": "I lifted the cat onto my laps. The cat calmly licked its paws in my lap like that’s what it wanted the  entire time. It even yawned with a meow.  "}
{"text": "‘I can’t believe it’s a person crazy for cats. The acting is incredible.’  I rubbed the cat’s head.  "}
{"text": "-Meooow.  As I was listening to the cat purr, a group of hunters came towards me. One of them spoke to me.  “Excuse me. Is your name Kim Gong-ja?”  "}
{"text": "“Mm.”  Just by a glance I could tell their equipment was expensive. They weren’t just a ragtag bunch. If not  guild masters, at least executives. A group of those kinds of people were gathered around the cafe.  "}
{"text": "I showed my ID to them.  “T wondered how long it would take. It took exactly 1 hour and 30 minutes I see.”  "}
{"text": "“ 1”  The hunters’ eyes shook upon seeing my ID. They frantically pulled their phones out and started to  "}
{"text": "contact others.  “Yes. I found him!”  “In the cafe right across the bank...”  "}
{"text": "“No. Other guilds are also here...yes. Yes, sir! Understood, boss.”  "}
{"text": "“Don’t worry. I won’t have him taken by other guilds!”  It was the eve of a storm.  I contentedly watched what was happening in front of me.  "}
{"text": "‘I feel like I’m a VIP.’  -Well. Most guilds will try to scout you. You cleared the 10th floor by yourself. That’s a real VIP.  "}
{"text": "‘Mm. I guess. Even a person who cleared the 99th floor calls me Gong-ja-nim, so it would be weird if I  wasn’t a VIP.’  "}
{"text": "-Fuck! Fuck! Fuuuck!  The hunters ended their calls one by one.  And they all looked at me with nervous faces.  "}
{"text": "As I waited for the first guild to speak up, a large blonde hunter took a step forward.  “T am the HR team leader of the Civil Militia Guild. Kim Gong-ja hunter-nim. As you may already  "}
{"text": "know, the Civil Militia is the most honorable guild in Babylon. If you enter our guild...!”  “Just a moment.”  "}
{"text": "I lifted my hand. The HR team leader of Civil Militia paused.  “Sorry for cutting you off. But let’s speak after two things are clearly established.”  “First. Let’s not leak anything to the media.”  "}
{"text": "I slowly looked at the hunters. I could guarantee that none of these hunters would be a lower rank than  me. Before I regressed, I wouldn’t even have dared to look at them. But now, I didn’t fall short to any  of them.  "}
{"text": "My performance.  I had the achievement of being the first person to subjugate the 10th floor.  This was like a landmark that no hunter could destroy regardless of their level.  "}
{"text": "Competent hunters considered performance important. If they were competent, they wouldn’t be able  to treat me like I was nothing.  "}
{"text": "“T won’t sign a contract with any guild that leaks my name to the public. I won’t even associate with  them. Please be aware.”  “Uh...u, until when?”  "}
{"text": "Another hunt raised their hand to ask.  “The Golden Newspaper reporters are sticking their noses into all the guilds...Kim Gong-ja-nim. I  don’t know how long we’|l be able to hide this.”  "}
{"text": "“Well, I’m not saying to hide this forever.”  I pointed at the sky.  "}
{"text": "The hunters all looked up at the sky too.  [22:25:31]  "}
{"text": "“Just until today. Until the clock reaches 00:00:00, please keep the ban.”  “Ah! Alright. Somehow until then...understood.”  The hunters all sighed in relief.  "}
{"text": "I smiled.  ‘I can’t be held up by reporters. Not when I have to run as fast I can to the 11th floor when it opens.’  I opened my mouth again.  "}
{"text": "“That’s the first condition. And for the second-”  oc ”  "}
{"text": "The hunters all looked at me with stiff expressions. They were probably nervous about what difficult  condition I would request.  "}
{"text": "I grinned and looked around me.  “-this is a public area so let’s respect the other customers.”  “Pardon?”  "}
{"text": "“Can’t you see the customers looking this way? They’re surprised because you all suddenly gathered  here.”  I was right.  "}
{"text": "All the other customers were looking this way. Most of the customers whispered to each other with  suspicious eyes. There was even a customer who looked like they were filming this.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s a nuisance.”  “IT know you were all rushed looking for me, but let’s take it slow. It’s not like I'll run away.”  "}
{"text": "“S, Sorry.”  The hunters realized the environment and dispersed.  “T’m sorry. I can’t tell you the reason but if you could move...”  "}
{"text": "“Sir. How much would it cost to rent this cafe for 1 hour?”  “Everyone, thank you for your understanding! If you come to Chen Mu-mun sometime, we'll...”  "}
{"text": "The scale of the large clans’ executives was definitely different.  It took 5 minutes for them to make everyone leave and rent to the cafe from the owner. The cafe was  "}
{"text": "empty after only 5 minutes.  “Alright.”  We entered a corner of the cafe and started to speak.  "}
{"text": "“Then let’s start the negotiations. State your conditions.”  Funnily, they all had a cup of coffee in their hands. It was because I said they were being a nuisance.  How cute.  "}
{"text": "“.,.Our Civil Militia offers 10,000 Gold for the contract fee.”  That was the starting point.  "}
{"text": "“10,000 Gold? Dang. You’re showing you’re poor in a place like this. Kim Gong-ja hunter-nim! Please  sign up with the Adventure League. We promise 20,000 Gold, and an executive position.”  "}
{"text": "“Come to Chen Mu-mun, hunter-nim. Our guild grows combat specific hunters and we’|] take you in as  a trainer with 25,000 Gold.”  “The position of a trainer is just annoying. Please think well. Kim Gong-ja hunternim! If you come into  "}
{"text": "our Ten Thousand Temple, we guarantee an honorary position. To be honest, we hope you promote our  clan. With 30,000 Gold and a separate pay for other jobs...”  “Association! Please work as an ambassador for the Association!”  "}
{"text": "It was a mess.  The HR team leaders all pleaded with me. I understood how they felt. All the high guilds probably felt  pressured by Sword Saint.  "}
{"text": "The lone hunter who didn’t register in any of the guilds who was Rank 1!  "}
{"text": "Because of that, people probably wondered. If there was really a need to register in a guild. If solo play  was the best option...  ‘Although it’s because Sword Saint is special.’  "}
{"text": "It still hurt the reputation of the guilds.  ‘And if a new hero that was as famous as the Sword Saint was born?’  I smiled.  "}
{"text": "‘They would do anything to scout him.’  At the very least, block other guilds from taking him!  "}
{"text": "Was probably the orders that these team leaders got. It was obvious.  “C, Civil Militia can give 36,000 Gold as the contract fee...”  “Sheesh. The poor guilds should step back. Hm?”  "}
{"text": "“Are you trying to fight us with thousands? Don’t you understand the situation?”  “Us Alchemy Castle can...!”  "}
{"text": "It was then.  “Sangryun.”  "}
{"text": "A heavy voice came from somewhere.  “50,000 Gold.”  The hunters all turned their heads. Their gazes landed on my lap. To be exact, it was the cat on my lap.  "}
{"text": "The cat meowed and jumped up. It’s feet were soft paws when it jumped off my lap, but when it  landed, that wasn’t the case. They lightly landed with shoes.  "}
{"text": "“50,000 Gold. I can give it to you here if you prefer.”  The person looked back. Clang. The 2 gold pieces on their necklace made a clear sound as they shook.  “And the spot of Sangryun’s vice leader position.”  "}
{"text": "Hunter Rank 3.  The guild master of the Merchant’s Association. Count.  "}
{"text": "“50,000 Gold and vice guild leader. How’s that.”  A woman with the skill of [Metamorphosis] brightly smiled and spoke. Although she was probably  over 40, she looked to be in her 20s. She was probably drinking elixirs everyday.  "}
{"text": "She was the wealthiest person in the tower.  “Mm.”  "}
{"text": "A bigwig that I wouldn’t have met in the past.  I forced myself to calm down and smiled.  "}

{"text": "Translator: HH  “Hmm. You got guts.”  Count slightly lifted a corner of her mouth.  "}

{"text": "The Guild Masters spoke one by one like they had been waiting. The only person to be surprised was  Venomous Snake.  "}

{"text": "Then, Bae Hu-ryeong, who had been quiet all this time, spoke up.  -They’re not much. Just think that they’re not that much! You were even killed by grandpops Marcus.  None of them are better than grandpops.  "}

{"text": "‘It’s just a mind game.’  And it was a twisted, tricky mind game.  "}
{"text": "I shrugged my shoulders.  “Store owner-nim. Do you have a menu?”  “Sorry?”  "}

{"text": "“A, Alright.”  Composure.  "}
{"text": "I had to show a composed attitude right now.  “These people didn’t randomly come here at once.’  Earlier, when the team leaders came, and now, the hunters all arrived at the same time.  "}
{"text": "Was this a coincidence?  “Never!”  A strategy hidden behind coincidence.  "}
{"text": "They were acting.  ‘This is a strategy to make me lose my composure.’  "}
{"text": "It was a high-class strategy, kind of like how gangsters ganged up on one person to threaten them.  “Well. Even if they’re a bit more scarier than hunters...’  It was a frozen and tense atmosphere.  "}
{"text": "‘It’s nothing compared to being burned alive.’  In other words, it was just a little ice.  "}
{"text": "Before I was killed by the Flame Emperor, I would’ve trembled in fear seeing these people...but not  anymore. I wasn’t scared at all.  The reason was ridiculously simple.  "}
{"text": "“Try to kill me if you want.’  Even if they killed me, I would be fine!  Bae Hu-ryeong nodded his head.  "}
{"text": "-Yeah. Like I said. That talent is your strength! Glare at them like they can try to kill you if they want.  Put power behind your eyes! Like these losers who can’t even kill you are acting tough!  "}
{"text": "‘Uh, thanks for the support. But I’m not going to let you off the hook.  -This damned...!  Bae Hu-ryeong grabbed his head in despair.  "}
{"text": "“Mm.”  On the other hand, the Heretic Questioner’s expression changed.  “Interesting. It seems like you didn’t do much before subjugating the 10th floor. A sudden change...  "}
{"text": "guess you can’t tell what’s gonna happen to anyone!”  “He did do something.”  The Count covered her mouth with her fan and smiled with her eyes.  "}
{"text": "“That youngster was chosen as my guild’s lottery winner. He’s got luck. And guts. And I don’t know  how, but seeing as he cleared the 10th floor, he’s got skills. Luck. Guts. Skills. If a youngster has those  3, they’ ll succeed.”  "}
{"text": "“Haa...so that’s why I said earlier!”  Venomous Snake sighed from across the table.  "}
{"text": "“Don’t do this and that and just scout him! Would the person who cracked the 10th floor be a newbie  who doesn’t know anything? Tsk. We put on an act even though it didn’t work...”  "}
{"text": "“That’s not important.”  The Guild Master of Black Dragon, who had been sitting quietly stood up.  “Just because some of our reputations were hurt doesn’t mean all of ours were. We’re all busy. Let’s  "}

{"text": "“Hunter Kim Gong-ja.”  The Witch looked at me.  “Tl ask directly. Which guild are you planning on signing up for?”  "}
{"text": "A steady gaze.  “If you’re planning on not registering in any guild like the Sword Saint, let us know in advance. We  have to discuss how to handle the media if that happens.”  "}
{"text": "“And if I’m planning on applying?”  “An intense auction will start.”  The Witch calmly spoke.  "}
{"text": "“We’ve stayed too long on the 9th floor. It was just tough. But since you cleared the 10th floor, the  chance to advertise the value of the Tower to the outside world has come again.”  "}
{"text": "“A chance, you say.”  “Yes. Chance. A chance to bring people from the outside who aren’t just war refugees.”  "}
{"text": "The barista brought a tray over and served coffee. No one spoke. The Witch just took a sip of her  hazelnut latte.  "}

{"text": "Since it was protecting the human empire, even a defense genre could be applied as well.  ‘It’s defeating the Devil King’s forces coming in hordes.’  Anyhow, from now, the level of fighting was different.  "}
{"text": "Monsters didn’t roam around by themselves like in the beginning hunting grounds. They formed  groups. Legions. They made an army.  "}

{"text": "I closed my eyes and,  [The transmission is complete. ]  When I opened my eyes, I was already on the 12th floor.  "}
{"text": "It was completely different from the 11th floor. Like the exact opposite. If the 11th floor was a dirty and  intense battlefield, the 12th floor was an extravagant palace. It was the Imperial Palace of the Aegim  Empire.  "}
{"text": "¢ ’  "}
{"text": ".. 10.  I looked around.  ‘Since the politics in the palace are as dirty and intense.’  "}
{"text": "In the reception room, other high challengers were summoned. There were people I saw for the first  time, but most of them were hunters I met already, like Witch and Count. Of course. They weren’t the  leaders of the large Guildss for nothing.  "}
{"text": "I met the eyes of the other hunters.  “Oh?”  “Mm.”  "}
{"text": "All of their reactions were different. There were some hunters who were smiling brightly at me like  they knew I would be here, and there were some with grimaces like they never would’ve expected me  here.  "}
{"text": "“Hunter Kim Gong-ja! You were amazing!”  The Heretic Questioner was the former.  “TI saw what you did on the 11th floor! To use the NPCs that way. I was touched!”  "}
{"text": "He ran over to me. Because he was so short, he seemed like a tiny puppy.  “Is the sword on your waist a special item? The NPCs seemed to follow you right away after seeing  you had this sword. Did you get this as a reward for clearing the 10th floor?  "}
{"text": "“Well. I guess...”  “As expected!”  "}
{"text": "He was all smiles looking up at me.  “You used the 10th floor reward to clear the 11th floor. Your application skills are amazing!”  “No, well. Not that...”  "}
{"text": "“From now, a lot of hunters will be jealous of you. They might even treat you as a lucky parvenu.  Ignore them! It’s all thanks to your skills!”  "}
{"text": "Uh.  What was this person?  "}

{"text": "-Be careful! Behind you...!  Then. Before Bae Hu-ryeong could finish, everything ended.  “Hm.”  "}

{"text": "He quietly muttered to himself. Then the sound of iron crashing against something else rang out. It was  simple iron.  "}
{"text": "It was an attack with clear murderous intent.  “Ha.”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner laughed.  His eyes weren’t laughing.  "}
{"text": "“That’s surprising, Sword Saint. When did you become an assassin?”  “Move.”  An old man dressed in a suit. Sword Saint spoke coldy.  "}
{"text": "His sword was raised at us.  No.  Never mind.  "}
{"text": "“T’m going to kill that guy.”  It wasn’t raised at us, but at me.  "}
{"text": "Silence descended on the reception room.  Like there was electricity in the air, my body felt sparked.  “Mm.”  "}
{"text": "Only Heretic Questioner spoke in an attitude that wasn’t much different than before.  “Excuse me. But by ‘that guy’ are you talking about Kim Gong-ja hunter?”  “Of course.”  "}
{"text": "Sword Saint replied.  “If you don’t move from there, one of your arms will be cut off as well.”  The Heretic Questioner had a beaming smile.  "}
{"text": "“That’s a bit difficult! I can’t move for you. Hunter Kim Gong-ja has received the acknowledgement of  the Five Large Guilds, including the Ten Thousand Temple. If I let him die, the reputation of the Five  Large Guilds will be hurt!”  "}

{"text": "“Can you tell me why you’re targeting hunter Kim Gong-ja?”  “T don’t have to tell you.”  "}
{"text": "“Are you saying you won’t give him up?”  “Move and stop the nonsense.”  "}
{"text": "Sword Saint firmly refused.  Yeah. In his eyes, I was a slaughterer who killed over 4000 people. Since he didn’t know my skill, he  "}
{"text": "would react like that.  “T’ll say it again, but I’m going to kill that guy.”  "}
{"text": "“Mm! Then you’ve left me with no choice.”  The Heretic Questioner gathered his hands.  “TI control you here. Holy Technique, Transmission God.”  "}
{"text": "Suddenly, light exploded behind Sword Saint. Two hunters appeared from the tight. Chen-mu Master  Venomous Snake. Civil Milita’s Vice Guild Leader Crusader. The two hunters shouted. Both of their  weapons were pointed at the Sword Saint.  "}
{"text": "“Haaaaaaa!”  Sword Saint furrowed his eyebrows.  “These pricks...”  "}
{"text": "He clicked his tongue. During the span of one click, he swung his sword once. His blue Aura split the  air and spilt blood. Two slashes. With just two attacks, the Crusader’s cheek was hurt. The Venomous  Snake’s arm was bleeding.  "}

{"text": "“Sigh.”  Crusader sighed.  "}
{"text": "“Focus on the opponent at hand. We’re at a disadvantage.”  Even while sighing, Crusader didn’t let down her guard. No, she seemed even more nervous. The  Heretic Questioner, Venomous Snake, and Crusader. The highest 3 hunters were fighting together, but  "}
{"text": "the Sword Saint was still gging. [TN: gg as in go go. ]  “Mm. We’re definitely at a disadvantage like this.”  Did the Heretic Questioner feel it too?  "}
{"text": "He smiled brightly and requested for help.  “Count!”  “What.”  "}
{"text": "“Please give me some money!”  “How much?”  "}
{"text": "“Thankfully the Sword Saint hasn’t lost his mind yet. It’11 be enough to control him for some time.  10,000 Gold please!”  "}
{"text": "“15% interest.”  Count unfolded her fan while quietly watching the fight.  “3 months time. Is this good?”  "}
{"text": "“Haha! You’ve misunderstood me! I didn’t ask to borrow money. I said to give me money.”  “Huh. Are you asking a merchant to donate?”  "}
{"text": "“Yes! That’s it! Isn’t it money you got from dirty deeds anyway? I’ll use it in a good place, so repent at  the temple and go to heaven!”  “You’re a worse thief than me...”  "}
{"text": "Count shook her head and pulled something out.  It was a pouch with a snail pattern on it.  Count untied the gold string at its entrance.  "}
{"text": "“Withdraw, 10,000 Gold.”  The pouch opened its mouth. A bunch of coins fell out. The pouch itself was probably a rare item. As  gold coins formed a small mountain, Count took her pouch back.  "}
{"text": "“There. Take it, priest. It’s exactly 10,000 Gold.”  “T’ll take it well!”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner smiled exuberantly and gathered his two hands.  “Holy Technique, Devotion!”  "}
{"text": "The gold on the floor emitted a light. A golden light filled the reception room. In the middle of it,  Heretic Questioner muttered, moving his hands rapidly.  “Holy transfer, physique strengthening. Receivers, Crusader and Venomous Snake. Time, 300 times.  "}
{"text": "Gold will grab our hands. Technique complete!”  “Mm.”  “Humph...”  "}
{"text": "And something strange happened. All the gold on the floor disappeared like it had never been there.  Instead, the light from the coins landed on the Crusader and the Venomous Snake. It was like Aura. The  Heretic Questioner spread his arms apart, saying, “Here we go.”  "}
{"text": "“For 300 seconds, Crusader and Chen-mu Master will become noticeably different. Sword saint! Even  if you’re strong, you can’t bear the attack of the four of us! Me, Count, Crusader, and Chen-mu  Master!”  "}

{"text": "“And the Count’s treasury isn’t empty. Haha. I don’t know if it ever will! If you want to test whether  the Count will become bankrupt first, or if your neck will be cut off first, go ahead!”  Count pouted from far away.  "}
{"text": "“Why are you pulling my treasury into this test! I just donated because that zealot told me to. Whew.  Being a merchant is hard both inside and outside the tower.”  "}
{"text": "“_,.and if I added something to that.”  A cold voice spoke. It was the Witch. The Rank 2 hunter broke her silence.  She looked at Sword Saint with an expressionless face.  "}
{"text": "“Tt won’t end with the four. I’ll show my intent to participate in the fight right now. Because hunter  Kim Gong-ja has made a deal with the Five Large Guilds.  "}
{"text": "Sword Saint frowned.  “A deal?”  “Yeah. A deal.”  "}
{"text": "The Witch nodded.  “Hunter Kim Gong-ja isn’t bound to a single place but applied to all Five Large Guilds. In return, we  promised to treat him as an equal. Sword saint. If you pull your sword towards Kim Gong-Ja, that  "}

{"text": "“Black Dragon. Sangryun. Ten Thousand Temple. Chen-mu Mun. Civil Militia.”  The mirrors floated up by themselves. And they started to spin around. One. Two. Three. In total, the  six mirrors spun around the Witch like they were hunting dogs protecting her.  "}
{"text": "“Can you really deal with all of us, Sword Saint?”  Swish.  "}
{"text": "The five hunters all pulled out their weapons towards Sword Saint.  The old sword wielder was quiet.  "}
{"text": "Yes.  ‘Even if the Sword Saint is freakishly strong.’  In this moment-  "}
{"text": "‘He’s not strong enough to have all of the Five Large Clans as his enemies.’  This was why I made a deal with the Guild Masters.  "}
{"text": "A day when I was stronger than Sword Saint could come. No, it would. But it wasn’t today or  tomorrow. So until that day came, I had to have a safety net.  I inwardly smiled.  "}
{"text": "‘Do you remember what I said on the 11th floor?’  -What?  "}
{"text": "‘That there are two ways to deal with a powerful opponent.’  Be a one-man army strong enough to chew your enemy up.  Or, make my own army and fight back.  ‘The Sword Saint is nothing more than a solo player.’  "}
{"text": "But I was different.  ‘T already have allies.’  "}
{"text": "So if Sword Saint and I fought, it would be my victory.  ‘See? This is my plan. Go ahead, be awed.’  -Tsk tsk. What a weak ass...  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong sighed.  But his face didn’t look too bad. He seemed pretty satisfied that I came up to the 12th floor with a  strategy. That ghost, although he didn’t show it, worried about a lot of things.  "}
{"text": "I took a step forward.  “Sword Saint-nim.”  "}
{"text": "The hunters all looked at me. And Sword Saint was amongst them. I smiled on purpose to seem  relaxed.  "}
{"text": "And I looked Sword Saint in the eye.  “Can we talk?”  Listen well. Because sir Gong-ja is speaking.  "}

{"text": "“)..Talk?”  “Yes. To be honest, I’m a bit taken aback right now.”  "}
{"text": "On the stage of the 12th floor, the palace, we were in the reception room. My voice rang out in the  middle of it.  "}
{"text": "“T don’t know why you’re attacking me. You may be seeing me for the first time, but I used to admire  your sword technique. Since you’re raising your sword to me like that, it’s really awkward for me.”  Sword Saint’s face stiffened.  "}
{"text": "Even though I was telling the truth.  ‘I guess he would be like that.’  "}
{"text": "There was a reason his face hardened like that.  The first day he met me, the day that he didn’t remember, Sword Saint had said this.  -Did you think I wouldn’t know you were an assassin sent from Black Dragon?  "}
{"text": "-I don’t know if the Witch sent you, but I’ll do my best to kill you!  He thought I was an assassin.  ‘And an assassin from the Black Dragon at that.’  "}
{"text": "He was probably thinking the same thing right now. That I was an assassin employed by Black Dragon  who killed many innocent lives. No, he might be even more sure of himself now.  "}
{"text": "‘Or a special assassin from the Five Large Guilds.’  -Mm. Right.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong nodded his head.  -From another’s respective, you’re really weird.  ‘Exactly.’  "}

{"text": "Five Large Guilds and was promised to be treated the same way as the Guild Masters...  ‘It’s too strange.’  "}
{"text": "-Right. From what grandpops Marcus sees, you’re not a hunter who worked hard to get there. You’re a  fake hero that the large guilds set up. Tsk tsk.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong tsked his tongue.  -Zombie. How many was your kill count at? 4090?  ‘It’s probably at 4093 now.’  "}
{"text": "-Right. The 4093 grandpops Marcus sees is just the number of people you’ve killed. Because you’re  not a hunter that moves alone, but a hunter that was created by the large guilds.  "}
{"text": "That was the only result that the Sword Saint could come to.  -And...  "}
{"text": "“Yes.”  The same bunch.  ‘He probably thinks of it as a number that I killed on orders from the large guilds.’  "}
{"text": "The large guilds that ruled the tower.  That they had killed 4093 humans.  It was a misunderstanding...but to him, it was probably a dirty sight.  "}
{"text": "“Hah.”  If he was less of a just geezer, he would’ve stepped back here.  “Babylon is no different from the outer world.”  "}
{"text": "But the Sword Saint didn’t know how to step back.  Even if he did, he denied it.  "}
{"text": "“After I entered the tower, you begged of me every day to apply to a guild. But I refused. Do you know  why?”  Sword Saint gripped his sword even more. His hands were old. Skin sagged. But the veins that popped  "}
{"text": "out weren’t old at all.  A lion’s teeth weren’t less sharp because of age.  “T wanted to show that in this tower. That in this new world, you could rule at the top alone.”  "}
{"text": "The Sword Saint looked around him with violent eyes.  “Family, country, where you’re from. Unlike the outer world, you can survive by yourself with a sword  in this place. If you work hard, you can succeed.”  "}
{"text": "“To show that hope to people, I didn’t join a guild until now. But what have you guys done?”  He lifted his blade.  “You’re no different from the rotten water riddled with dirt.”  "}
{"text": "The Guild Masters squirmed.  "}
{"text": "Rage. Humiliation. Hate.  Emotions swirled in their eyes. What the Sword Saint just said was an announcement for war.  There were some who just smiled like it was nothing, like the Heretic Questioner, but most of the guild  "}
{"text": "masters’ faces didn’t look too good.  “Sword Saint. I don’t know about others but you...”  "}
{"text": "“Ha! You forgot about how you just skipped out when we were subjugating the 5th floor? Seems like  you forgot because of Alzheimer’s!”  "}
{"text": "“Yeah, Mr. Calenberry. If you used your connections from the outer world, we would have more food,  and Sangryun...”  They all shouted.  "}
{"text": "All the hunters here had known each other from the beginning of the tower. Was it because they had a  lot of held back emotions towards each other? As emotion clashed against emotion, the atmosphere in  the reception room soon became dark.  "}
{"text": "“If you’re a Rank 1, you should’ve shown the attitude appropriate of it. But you were all good yourself.  You lived by yourself. Do you know how many hunters we could’ve saved if you didn’t act so  arrogant?”  "}
{"text": "The Witch of Black Dragon spoke like she was cursing him.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s not just the 5th floor. If you helped us on the 7th and 9th floor, we would’ve suffered half the  damage!”  The Venomous Snake of Chen-mu Mun showed murderous intent.  "}
{"text": "“Someone who was from a rich family in the outside world. If you helped a bit, the tower would’ve  been more settled. We’re rotten water? Fine. Then you’re a kid that doesn’t have any responsibility.”  "}
{"text": "Count glared at him.  It was a mess.  "}
{"text": "Even with the curses and murderous gazes of the Guild Masters, Sword Saint just grimaced. Every time  he spoke, he made it worse.  “Be quiet.”  "}
{"text": "its ”  "}
{"text": "“What are you adults blabbering on about...do you think I’m your grandfather? Put it away. If you’re  gonna attack, attack with the sword.”  The reception room became uncontrollably violent.  "}
{"text": "-Dang! As expected of grandpops. Definitely my one and only disciple.  Bae Hu-ryeong couldn’t read the mood and just exclaimed in astonishment.  "}
{"text": "-There’s nothing more disgusting than players talking about connections or politics. If you have time to  worry about that, you should fight with your sword instead!  "}
{"text": "What he said made sense.  But...  I had a regretful heart.  "}
{"text": "“Even in a place with just 10 people, you fight.”  The hunters all looked at me.  I sighed.  "}
{"text": "“Even the NPCs of the 11th floor fought to protect their empire. But look. Hunters like us are just  pointing fingers at each other saying whose fault it is. Isn’t it embarrassing to be worse than NPCs?”  "}
{"text": "“.’,. Hunter Kim Gong-ja.”  The Witch spoke.  "}
{"text": "“Tt doesn’t have anything to do with you. It’s worse than what you...”  “I know. I get it but...there something that we should do if we’re hunters.”  I looked around the reception room.  "}

{"text": "“Tt’s good to give hope to people, and respectable to decrease damage, it’s all good. But please work at  clearing the stage that’s in front of you.”  "}
{"text": "I especially looked at Sword Saint.  “They’re just NPCs...but their empire is in danger. They want help. If we were summoned as warriors  and just fight with words amongst ourselves, how pathetic is that.”  "}
{"text": "“You ”  I was being genuine.  "}
{"text": "Sword Saint couldn’t threaten my life here anyway. Since the gap in power was too clear. Then my  only focus was clearing the 12th floor.  "}
{"text": "I wasn’t interested in their politics or their emotional qualms.  “What’s a warrior? Helping others solve what they can’t. Since we cleared the 11th floor, let’s solve the  other stages as well.”  "}
{"text": "“Kim Gong-ja is right.”  "}
{"text": "Thankfully, there was a hunter who agreed.  Crusader.  The Civil Milita’s Vice Guild Leader stepped up.  "}
{"text": "“T don’t understand why Sword Saint attacked Kim Gong-ja. But this isn’t the time for us to fight. That  one thing is clear. You’re all too tense right now.”  "}
{"text": "Crusader stepped to the center. But no one let their guards down. Sword Saint, Venomous Snake,  Count, and Heretic Questioner were still ready to attack if needed.  "}
{"text": "They were too distrustful of each other to convince each other with words.  Because of the emotions that were held back for a long amount of time.  “Sigh.”  Realizing that, Crusader sighed.  "}
{"text": "“Fine. Ill sacrifice a little.”  At the word sacrifice, the hunters looked back.  "}
{"text": "Crusader murmured to herself at the center of attention.  “Skill card open.”  Whoosh!  "}
{"text": "Light soared up from Crusader’s hand. A moment later, a silver card appeared. It was a card that no one  else could see unless the hunter allowed them to. It was the skill card of Crusader.  "}
{"text": "«'.. Vice Guild Leader.”  The Witch seemed worried about the Crusader. The high rankers didn’t reveal their skill cards towards  "}
{"text": "others. It was the secret weapon of a hunter. Showing it to others was like revealing your weakness.  “Tt’s fine. It doesn’t matter.”  "}

{"text": "“_..Crusader. You’re the only person who hasn’t hurt anyone here. Fine. I’ll believe you as well.”  The Sword Saint spoke mysterious words and accepted it.  Crusader nodded.  "}

{"text": "The first sound to break the silence was someone clacking their teeth together.  “You foolish...!”  The Guild Master of the Black Dragon, and Rank 2. It was the Witch.  "}
{"text": "“T said not to pick the Devil King’s reward! But you still...stupid!”  A murderous aura swirled around the Witch. Her face wasn’t emotionless like it always was. Hate.  Fury. She looked around, face crumpled in anger.  "}
{"text": "“Well. I guess words wouldn’t work on a stupid fool. Fine! I’1l make a proclamation as the master of  Black Dragon here. I don’t know who dared to betray us, but I’ll present to them the most painful  death.”  "}
{"text": "“Hm. Surprising.”  Heretic Questioner stroked his chin.  "}
{"text": "“This is a game that’s way disadvantageous to the betrayer. But you still chose it...as the Black Dragon  Master said, it’s a foolish choice! Haha. Well, it’s definitely human-like to make such a foolish  decision”  "}
{"text": "“Ah...fuck.”  The Venomous Snake scratched the back of his head.  "}
{"text": "“Ah, I know. I know. This atmosphere. It’s like when we first challenged the tower...my back and my  neck feel fucking cold. Some people are gonna die today.”  “T know, right? It’s like when the Five Large Clans were the Ten Large Clans.”  "}
{"text": "The Count opened her fan. She had a lazy tone. But her eyes behind her fan were as sharp as a beast’s.  “A lot of people died then. And killed a lot too. Isn’t that right?”  “Shut up! Everyone be quiet. It’s not the time to think about the old times right now.”  "}
{"text": "The Witch’s face was twisted.  “Crusader!”  "}

{"text": "“Yes! Please ask whatever you need to!”  "}
{"text": "“Are you the person who chose the Devil King’s reward?”  “Sorry.”  In the midst of all the silence, Heretic Questioner laughed. The sound of laughter echoed on the marble  "}

{"text": "We descended on the silence.  “Wait...what?”  The Venomous Snake looked around.  "}
{"text": "“Who is it then?”  Sword Saint looked at the Witch. The Witch looked at the Heretic Questioner. The Heretic Questioner  "}

{"text": "“Fuck! Who betrayed us?”  No one.  No one answered.  "}

{"text": "It probably wasn’t a voice that only I heard. Everyone’s face darkened.  And the Crusader spoke with much difficulty in that silence.  “...Calm down.”  "}
{"text": "No one opened their mouths even though she said to calm down. How were they supposed to speak?  They looked like they were all seriously in thought.  "}
{"text": "“Don’t be taken aback. Yes. Maybe the betrayer has the skill to hide their lies. And there might be  someone with a split personality. Everyone has their secret weapon, right? So it’s not impossible...”  “Or.”  "}
{"text": "Sword Saint spoke up.  He was looking at the Crusader coldly.  "}
{"text": "“Or, you might be the dirty betrayer.”  The reception room became silent.  "}
{"text": "Gazes sharper than knives were exchanged. Just now, the Sword Saint and Guild Masters had been  about to fight. The heat and sweat of that hadn’t cooled down, but it was beginning to waver again.  The Witch narrowed her eyes.  "}
{"text": "“Are you doubting us right now?”  “Yes.”  Sword Saint admitted it directly.  "}
{"text": "“Even if Ms. Crusader isn’t the betrayer, she could’ve lied to us. You all. You were all close as the  controllers of the Five Large Guilds since a long time ago. A crow hides with other crows. Aren’t you  protecting each other?”  "}
{"text": "“Sigh, you’re really...”  “Of course!’  "}
{"text": "The Crusader shouted out frantically. Sword Saint and the Witch stopped arguing to look at her. She  tried to speak calmly.  “Of course, logically speaking, it could be me. Yes. I could be the betrayer.”  "}
{"text": "“But we all have to keep our cool. It’s alright. We’ve faced many dangers before. Isn’t that right! So if  we just trust ourselves we can...”  "}
{"text": "“Hahaha.”  Someone laughed.  "}
{"text": "“You’re quite innocent. No, naive.”  It was the Heretic Questioner.  “Trust. Mm. Trust. It’s beautiful! But we need time to trust each other. Us Five Large Guilds have spent  "}

{"text": "“And it would be inefficient to take 10 years to stack up trust with everyone. Yes, it’s a waste of time!”  “... Wait.”  "}
{"text": "The Crusader’s face was frantic as well. I couldn’t feel her relaxedness back when she asked me if a  girl who graduated with a music degree was charming.  "}
{"text": "“This isn’t the time to talk about efficiency. Heretic Questioner. Please...”  “Holy Technique.”  The Heretic Questioner gathered his hands.  "}
{"text": "“Divine Body.”  White light surrounded his hands.  "}
{"text": "“Venomous Snake. You take care of the 10th.”  The light spread around.  “T’Il kill the 8th and 9th.”  "}
{"text": "“Heretic Questioner! You can’t!”  “Holy Technique, Divine Transmission.”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner and Venomous Snake disappeared. In the blink of an eye, the Heretic  Questioner was holding someone’s back. It was the hunter who finished as 8th. The hunter instinctively  looked back.  "}

{"text": "The hunter’s body tilted.  The hunter that wasn’t bound to any guild, had the immense power of Sword Saint, or had an alliance  with the guilds like me, the hunter that had climbed to where he was with his own power, died just like  "}

{"text": "“Disgusting! You’re not the slightest bit different as before! Stop this instant. If you don’t stop, [’Il-”  “Holy Technique, Divine Transmission.”  With a flashing light, the Heretic Questioner disappeared.  "}
{"text": "The hunter who was 9th ran away as soon as they saw the 8th and 10th hunter die. But the moment he  tried to leave, the Heretic Questioner appeared right in front of his nose.  "}
{"text": "“Ah,”  The hunter stretched his hand out.  “W, wait-”  "}
{"text": "“Yes!”  The Heretic Questioner smiled from ear to ear.  "}
{"text": "“Sorry!”  The hunter’s head exploded. The hunter fell over with one arm extended. Plop. The headless body  "}
{"text": "lightly fell over. Blood and flesh that burst with the explosion was spread out everywhere.  [A warrior has died. ]  "}
{"text": "[They are not the servant of the Devil King. ]  [The Goddess of Protection is silent. |  [The Devil King of Fall Rain is clapping his hands. ]  "}
{"text": "“Mm.”  The Heretic Questioner pulled out his handkerchief.  "}
{"text": "His face was red with the blood of the hunters who died. He lazily wiped his face. With just three  wipes, the handkerchief was soaked in blood.  “So it wasn’t the three!”  "}
{"text": "It was silent.  “This is tricky. I thought the betrayer would be along the 3! Haha. Then that means that betrayer is  among us. Seems like the trust of 10 years will disappear in a moment!”  "}
{"text": "He threw the red handkerchief to the ground.  It fell in a puddle of blood and floated like a paper sailboat.  "}
{"text": "“T said wait...”  The Crusader’s shoulders were shaking.  "}
{"text": "“T said to wait. I definitely said so...didn’t I ask you to wait! I asked you to be calm, Heretic  Questioner, and like the past...!  “You’re being strange. Vice Guild Master! I’m calm right now.”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner smiled.  Like it wasn’t enough, he pulled out a handkerchief with his right hand.  “T calmly came to the decision that the three were most likely to be the criminal. Although it was  "}
{"text": "wrong! Let’s be on the positive side and think that we got rid of the three most suspicious people. Ah. If  the media saw, it would’ve been bad, but no one was filming so-”  It was that moment.  "}
{"text": "The handkerchief flew in the air.  The clean white handkerchief that hadn’t wiped blood yet floated up. Before it fell, something that was  heavier fell first.  "}
{"text": "It was the right arm of the Heretic Questioner.  "}
{"text": "“Ah.”  It might’ve been a relief it was just that.  "}
{"text": "If the Venomous Snake didn’t stop the attack of the Sword Saint, it might’ve been his head.  “Fuck...!”  The Venomous Snake cursed and stood in front of the Sword Saint.  "}
{"text": "“Hey, zealot! Let us know if you’re going to kill someone beforehand!”  “Ahh.”  The Heretic Questioner looked down. The handkerchief landed a moment later. It quickly turned red.  "}
{"text": "“This is difficult now, not just tricky. I can’t help without both hands. Sorry, everyone! I can’t be of  help anymore!”  "}
{"text": "“Ts...that...the...problem now...!”  The Venomous Snake looked like he was struggling against the Sword Saint’s attacks.  “Someone...fucking....help me! I’m gonna die! Seriously!”  "}
{"text": "“Kim Gong-ja!”  The Crusader shouted.  "}
{"text": "“I’m leaving everything to you! You can even take my life!”  It was more of a scream.  "}
{"text": "“Only you didn’t receive the reward! Others might be the betrayer, but only you’re not! You 100% not  “So please, I’m asking this of you! Stop the Sword Saint!”  "}
{"text": "The sounds of swords clashing against each other filled the room. The Witch and the Count were  helping Venomous Snake. Only the Crusader was looking at me.  "}
{"text": "I momentarily looked at the fight in front of me.  ‘Sword Emperor.’  -Hm? What?  "}
{"text": "‘...Am I destined to be loved by psychopaths or something?’  I had expected something like this would happen.  "}
{"text": "I thought they would raise their swords at each other if a betrayer came up. So I had given up the  reward.  But.  "}
{"text": "‘T didn’t think it would become like this...’  I sighed.  "}
{"text": "“Ah, that’s good! It’s not a bad idea!”  Heretic Questioner popped up between me and Crusader. He was holding his arm to stop the bleeding.  "}
{"text": "Surprisingly, his face didn’t seem pained.  “In these cases, a lot of people only get in the way. So it’s better to focus on the person who’s not the  betrayer.”  "}
{"text": "“So you’re saying...”  “Yes!”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner smiled brightly.  “T’ll give all judgement to you!”  "}
{"text": "“Mm, I thought the criminal would be from the 3, but nothing can be done about it anymore! I don’t  trust myself. Hunter Kim Gong-ja. I’ll do what you say!”  Bae Hu-ryeong muttered.  "}
{"text": "—Yes. Yeah. I think you’re destined to be loved by psychos. Guys like this aren’t common. There was  only about 1 of them in my tower.  "}
{"text": "I really didn’t like this fate.  ‘T even got all authority from the Vice Guild Master and the Guild Master...’  -You’ve been promoted. Wasn't this why you gave up the reward? I was impressed by you right now.  "}
{"text": "‘I knew it would become a mess but not like this. What should we do about those poor people? I guess  I’ll have to regress...’  "}
{"text": "I glanced at the Crusader behind me.  She was gripping her head.  “Uh. I have a question.”  "}
{"text": "See ALeGs  Did she already know what I was going to ask.  “He was already like that.”  "}
{"text": "‘He’ was the Heretic Questioner.  “When we first entered the tower, it was pandemonium. Everyone believed in different religions, and  "}
{"text": "they split and made up again. Then, the Heretic Questioner appeared and...”  “And?”  “..Killed them all.”  "}
{"text": "She sighed again.  “He completely killed everyone who fought because of religion. That’s the only way he knows...”  “Wow.”  "}
{"text": "I thought he had peacefully settled things with everyone, because that’s what the media said. But to  think such a massacre was behind all of it...  "}
{"text": "“Save....me!”  The Venomous Snake screamed a bit over where I was.  "}
{"text": "It felt like the octave increased with every minute.  “Dying! Fu...ck! I’m really dying! The Chen-mu Master is going to die, you bastards!”  “Hahaha.”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner fixed his cap with his left hand.  “I’m sorry for making this mess. Kim Gong-ja hunter! Can’t you please stop the Sword Saint with the  condition of my authority!”  "}
{"text": "“Sigh. You...never mind.”  I shook my head.  "}
{"text": "“Let’s talk about you later. Very deeply. But I’1l take care of this right now because I think Venomous  Snake will really die right now.”  "}
{"text": "“Yes! Thank you!”  “Well. It’s nice to be able to control Ten Thousand Temple and the Civil Militia if only for a bit...’  I convinced myself.  "}
{"text": "There was an intense fight going on. To join it would be suicide.  But I knew the magic word to stop the Sword Saint.  “Sword Saint-nim!”  "}
{"text": "There was no reply.  “Sword Saint-nim! Since you already bowed your head to me once again, please listen to me! Let’s  "}
{"text": "stop fighting and talk!”  There was still no reaction.  "}
{"text": "Ah. There was no other choice.  I took a deep breath, and shouted.  “T’ll ask your granddaughter out!”  "}
{"text": "Pause.  “If your granddaughter enters the tower. Yes, I’1l meet her once. I don’t know if we’ll go out, but since  "}
{"text": "I might be your grandson in law, please listen to me!”  He quietly looked at me.  “...[’m not forgiving them.”  "}
{"text": "“Yes.”  “I’m not stopping because of what you said. I just thought that it might be better to find the betrayer  and kill them after. Right?”  "}
{"text": "Why are you asking me-  Was what I stopped myself from asking, and I nodded my head instead.  "}
{"text": "“Ah, yes you’re right. You can kill them after.”  “Mm.”  The Sword Saint pulled his sword back.  "}
{"text": "Opposite of his, the Venomous Snake was panting hard.  “Everyone. Please calm down.”  "}
{"text": "I spoke looking at the hunters.  “T don’t know who’s the betrayer. We might not find out. But that’s another problem. We can defeat the  problem even without finding them.”  "}
{"text": "“....How?” the Crusader asked.  “The fact that they accepted the reward means they can stab us in the back any moment.”  "}
{"text": "“Look at this.”  I pointed at the marble ground. What the Heretic Questioner had engraved was still on there.  “Tt says the Devil King’s Core is on the 20th floor.”  "}
{"text": "I looked at each of them one by one.  “Don’t focus on finding the betrayer, it’s a trap. Don’t fall for it. The betrayer might be scared out of  their wits right now, and they might have been forcefully picked by the system. Who knows?”  "}
{"text": "“Let’s get rid of the Devil King first.”  It became silent.  "}
{"text": "“If we get rid of the Devil King, his reward will disappear as well. It’s simple. No matter what kind of  ridiculous test the tower offers, the solution is simple.  "}

{"text": "Drip. Drip.  It was rain.  "}
{"text": "Rain slid down the fancy window in the reception room. For a moment, we turned out gazes to look  outside. It wasn’t because we were surprised by the sound. There was something else that made us  surprised.  "}
{"text": "“Uh, uhhbhh...”  “Nightmare! The rain of nightmare is pouring down again!”  The color of the rain.  "}
{"text": "It was as red as blood. No, it might’ve been actual blood. The NPCs who were with us started to hold  their heads and groan.  “Goddess, please don’t abandon us!”  "}
{"text": "“W, What? Why are they suddenly being like this...?”  The exhausted Venomous Snake looked around him.  “Tt’s the Devil King...”  "}

{"text": "[The Devil King of Fall Rain is agreeing with you.]  The rain poured down harder. The sound that was like someone knocking instantly became even more  quiet. Tens of red drops covered the window.  "}

{"text": "“Good thing it’s not a messy port.”  The hunters looked around like they were tourists.  "}
{"text": "“Huh, is this holy rain? The color is...”  “Go under the roof! Quickly!”  “Hey. It says to choose a role as my reward.”  "}
{"text": "“Role? What’s that?”  The hunters didn’t understand the situation. Was it because they arrived later than us?  ‘Even the highest rankers suspected and fought each other.’  "}

{"text": "The citizens of the kingdom knew, the generals knew, and the Directors of Security and Education  knew.  That was why there hadn’t been any NPCs in the reception room.  "}
{"text": "Because the chancellor had quit politics.  Because the Supreme General had quit the army.  "}
{"text": "Because the bodyguards didn’t guard the Emperor anymore.  Because the knightages didn’t do the duty of knights.  It was an empire that everyone had abandoned.  "}
{"text": "That was why the tower had chosen the empire as its stage.  Like an estate of the 10th floor with children that everyone had abandoned.  “Rise!”  "}
{"text": "The Witch of Black Dragon shouted.  The soldiers all stood up. There were some who gripped the wall to stand up. There were some who  "}

{"text": "“Rise!”  “The chancellor is here! With us!”  "}

{"text": "The Witch’s face became expressionless again. Huh? I didn’t understand what the Black Dragon Master  just said.  "}

{"text": "-Gwoooo!  The monsters were right in front of us. Arrow flew. They were from the soldiers above the city walls. It  wasn’t enough to stop the red wave. Goblin, ork, skeletons, and other monsters ran at us.  "}

{"text": "-Zombie.  I heard Bae Hu-ryeong’s voice.  -Even a minute is ok. No, 30 seconds.  "}
{"text": "Tens, hundreds, of monsters were flying through the clouds.  And tens times that number was rumbling the ground towards us.  -Endure it yourself.  "}
{"text": "There weren’t any allies stopping me.  -To win this battle, you must become hope to these people.  "}
{"text": "So I was standing at the very front alone.  -Endure it by yourself. Even 30 seconds is ok. It’s important that you show you can stop those monsters  by yourself. You don’t call a human who lived for 30 years a hero. The 30 seconds that everyone needs.  "}

{"text": "some lessons.  Thump.  "}
{"text": "My heart beat faster.  -Take a step back.  My heart beat faster.  -Look ahead.  "}
{"text": "I did.  -There’s two goblins in front. They can’t see that well because of the dust. Quickly swing your sword  before them.  "}
{"text": "My heart beat even faster.  "}
{"text": "Each second felt slower.  -The Holy Sword shines, but it can take away sight as well. Take your opponents eyes with your sword,  and get time from your opponent.  "}
{"text": "And so a second for me was faster than my heart.  -They’re here.  "}
{"text": "My sword would be a second faster than me.  -Let’s go. Partner.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong stood next to me.  -It’s time to be a hero.  I swung my sword. Blood flowed everywhere.  "}
{"text": "The goblin screamed. In my second, the scream didn’t stop.  -One down.  "}
{"text": "Blood scattered in the air. It was the same color as the rain. I gripped my sword even tighter. And  swung it.  -Keeeeeeeeeea!  "}
{"text": "Two.  Before the 1st goblin tied, I cut the second goblin. It was an instant. Blood flowed from my right and  left. The monsters shouted without even being able to see my sword.  "}
{"text": "I killed one, and another.  -Aeeeeee!  "}
{"text": "-Aaaeeeeeeeee!  Before a monster could finish screaming, another monster screamed.  "}
{"text": "The screams around me didn’t end.  The orchestra of my sword.  I directed them with my conducting stick.  "}
{"text": "-1 second has passed.  Bae Hu-ryeong spoke.  "}
{"text": "-Don’t cut off your sword when you swing. Gong-ja. Don’t divide each attack, and connect them.  I swung my sword.  "}
{"text": "-Cut from the top to bottom. Think. It’s no different from music. When a tone pitches down, it can be  pulled back up.  "}
{"text": "Screams rang out.  -Connect! If your sword is low, bring it back up again. That’s how your sword can continue to connect.  Another second passed.  "}
{"text": "-A sword is a fight of time! If it’s swung once, it’s over. But a more skilled person can control 5  seconds.  Enemies let out blood.  "}
{"text": "And I let out my breath.  -Don't lose time!  "}
{"text": "Before the blood poured. And my breath faded.  -Don’t waste anything! Just because you cut your opponent, it’s not over. You have to know where to cut  next! Don’t throw away a second. Live it.  "}
{"text": "A blade swung between my breathing and the blood of my enemy.  -A sword user lives by their sword.  "}
{"text": "I swung my sword.  -Do you think it’s easy to live a second? Do you really want to leave?  I swung my sword.  "}
{"text": "-People aren't alive when they spend time. Gong-ja. You are a sword user. So you need to live by your  sword.  "}
{"text": "I swung my sword again.  -Burn it up!  "}
{"text": "A goblin scratched me and blood spilled from my arm. Ah. I felt dizzy. Even in the pain, I swung my  sword, and looked forward.  -Knrir,kr...  "}
{"text": "-Kwoooooo!  Countless monsters.  Monsters were pouring from the dust cloud. Countless enemies, and countless evil. They were all  "}
{"text": "trying to kill me.  -10 seconds now.  "}
{"text": "This was 10 seconds. It had only been 10 seconds.  -Burn more, Gong-ja. Don’t spill your life, and burn it up.  I tightened my grasp on the sword.  "}
{"text": "-It’s time to show who you are.  I shouted loudly.  "}
{"text": "In the cracks of the city walls, my shout rumbled. The soldiers on top flinched. The monsters coming  from far away paused.  "}

{"text": "I ran forward.  -Gwo...?  "}

{"text": "The ogre’s body was already stumbling.  It was hard for the ogre to change his direction.  "}

{"text": "-It’s been 30 seconds.  Then, someone passed by me.  "}
{"text": "I could tell who it was just by looking at their back. The strongest hunter in the tower pulled out his  sword.  "}
{"text": "Tens of goblins lost their necks, and tens of orcs lost their backs. And tens of streaks of blood poured  down as one.  One second. Two seconds. Three seconds.  "}
{"text": "It was only a moment, but I saw it. The blood streaming from the sky was darker than the rain.  Sword Saint slowly looked back at me, turning his back towards the pools of blood he created. He  opened his mouth.  "}
{"text": "ts ”  "}
{"text": "I didn’t understand what he said.  My time was still slow.  “Mm.”  "}
{"text": "Did he realize that my condition wasn’t normal?  He smiled, and spoke with Aura this time.  "}
{"text": "“it was amazing.”  The old man lifted his sword.  "}
{"text": "It rained.  The rain was red, so after the water poured down, the sword was red as well.  “My name is Marcus Calenberry. Youngster.”  "}
{"text": "I realized that he was trying to be polite.  I closed my mouth.  "}
{"text": "This was the second time a Rank 1 hunter told me his name.  The first time was when I was on the 1st floor.  The Flame Emperor tilted my head back and whispered.  "}
{"text": "-My name is Yoo Soo-ha.  -Farewell.  "}
{"text": "I died that day.  I heard a name for the second time today. They were different names and different people.  Suddenly, it occurred to me that I was different as well.  "}
{"text": "And I was able to do something that I wasn’t able to do the first time.  “My name is Kim Gong-ja. Sir.”  Today.  "}
{"text": "I spoke my name.  4.  The rain poured.  "}
{"text": "The fire burned everything in its way, and the rain had to fall from the sky.  “Mm.”  The rain poured.  "}
{"text": "There was an old man standing in the middle of it.  He nodded his head at me.  "}
{"text": "“Let’s fight together, Youngster.”  The Rank 1 hunter.  "}
{"text": "Sword Saint.  Grand Master of Knights of the Aegim Empire.  "}
{"text": "Alliance.  “-A hahaha!”  The rain poured.  "}
{"text": "“Mm! Sorry I’m late!”  With the sound of puddles being splashing, laughter approached us.  “T could’ve come faster. I guess it’s not easy to lead a legion!’  "}
{"text": "The speaker had one arm. It was a road where everything was damaged. The one-armed man stood  firm.  "}
{"text": "“Thank you. Hunter Kim Gong-ja.”  The Heretic Questioner fixed his cap with the hand he had.  "}
{"text": "The rain poured.  Far away from behind the Heretic Questioner, something crowded over to us.  “We’ll take over the time that you got for us.”  "}
{"text": "Thousands of soldiers.  The soldiers of the empire were jumping over holes past the puddles. No, there were even those who  weren’t soldiers. They were citizens who didn’t have any armor.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s the order of the Supreme General. Everyone.”  The Heretic Questioner smiled.  "}
{"text": "Thousands of soldiers and ten thousands of citizens shouted.  “Defeat the bastards who bared their teeth at the empire.’  The Rank 4 hunter.  "}
{"text": "Ten Thousand Temple Master, Heretic Questioner.  The Supreme General of the empire.  “Whoooooooo0!”  "}
{"text": "The rain poured.  The monsters who had been coming like hail, stopped. They hesitated. The tables were turned. Water  "}
{"text": "started to flow backwards from where the city walls were broken.  “The god is with us!”  The rain poured.  "}
{"text": "“Hurrah for the Aegim Empire!”  "}
{"text": "The rain poured.  ‘Ah.’  I couldn’t know when I had started to flow with the water. It was probably because of my Aura. I was  "}
{"text": "running as a small drop in the water.  Refugees from other countries raised their spears from my left. Farmers from the empire raised their  rakes to my right. When I looked backed, hunters like me were running.  "}
{"text": "A hunter I saw raised their sword.  "}
{"text": "They were continuing to say something, but,  “ 1”  "}
{"text": "I didn’t understand them.  Was it because of the rain? Or the people shouting? Oh, was it the screams of the monsters? Because  "}
{"text": "time slowed down? Was it because I became a small drop of water flowing with them?  Or, was it because I was swinging my sword.  "}
{"text": "“ 1”  Forward.  "}
{"text": "oc ”  "}
{"text": "Even more forward.  Until water covered everywhere the fire was.  Just a bit more forward.  "}
{"text": "“-hey.”  Something touched my shoulder. It pierced through the ten thousands of voices and said something to  me. It was one-eyed.  "}
{"text": "“Good job. I should’ve come earlier. I was late because I was bringing out guild members. But don’t  worry. We’ll show you why we’re called Chen-mu mun from now on...”  "}
{"text": "Pause.  It stopped speaking. Why? It stopped, and looked into my eyes with its one eye instead.  “You’re not listening. Are you immersed? Nice. I like it.”  "}
{"text": "It laughed.  “Hey, my name is Liao Fan. You can’t hear, but it doesn’t matter. ... you saved my life in the reception  "}
{"text": "room earlier. I can’t forget about a debt as the Master of Chen-mu mun, right? Just run with your eyes  forward. I’ll take the left. This is a huge benefit.”  It raised its sword.  "}
{"text": "“No one who stood on my right ever died.”  The rain poured.  “Go. Holy Technique.”  "}
{"text": "I swung my sword.  “T’Il protect you.”  "}
{"text": "The water became even more violent.  It flowed violently.  "}
{"text": "“Sorry I’m late! I was busy looking for the Emperor. I found him, but he had already committed  suicide. It'll be hard to use his authority. Sorry.”  “Tt’s fine. We don’t need to gather any more people. Ms.Crusader, you should fight too.”  "}
{"text": "“Of course. Hm? Why is Kim Gong-ja hunter...”  “Don’t bother him.”  The rain poured.  "}
{"text": "“That guy. Is having the time of his life.”  The rain poured.  "}
{"text": "-Pitiful things.  -Even if time is given, did you think it was for you?  "}
{"text": "-Even the power of the goddess protecting you is gone. There is no god in the empire anymore. What  did you expect? Will you prove yourselves? Fine.  Laughter came with the rain.  "}
{"text": "-Look.  A red light.  "}
{"text": "However, there were things blocking me.  And there were a lot.  “Hey, Witch! Get rid of them quickly!”  “TI know. I won’t let them go twice.”  "}
{"text": "“Geezer! You and I should cut them when the Witch scatters them!”  "}
{"text": "“T can do it by myself.”  “They’re starting to come, everyone!”  The rain poured.  "}
{"text": "“-scatter.”  Six rays of light shined. It was the light of mirrors. The red light slid against the mirror. The first,  second, and third mirror broke. But the 4th mirror continued to reflect the red light.  "}
{"text": "“Sword Saint! Venomous Snake!”  Something shouted.  "}
{"text": "“Hup.”  There was the sound of intaking breath.  "}
{"text": "“Yaaaaaa!”  And the sound of it being exhaled.  The sky split.  "}
{"text": "Even the red light split. It was light the ocean was being split into half.  Five different voices chattered on.  “Look! Look! I’ve still got a while before I die!”  "}
{"text": "“You’re continuing to blabber on.”  “This is the time!”  "}
{"text": "And a voice whispered amongst them.  “T’]l transport you next to the Devil King. Everyone get around me!”  “Quickly! If the Devil King summons monsters again we’ll be back at the starting point!”  Five voices overlapped.  "}
{"text": "They gathered into one place.  And.  "}
{"text": "“Kim Gong-ja!”  Someone extended their hand.  Rain was dripping down their face.  "}
{"text": "“Hold on!”  “Hurry, there’s no time!”  "}
{"text": "At that moment.  The time that seemed like forever was released.  "}
{"text": "I could see the people around me.  I could hear the sounds around me.  "}
{"text": "That wasn’t all. Memories of where I was and how I got here flooded inside my head.  It was the middle of the battlefield.  The soldiers and citizens were pushing away the monsters. Hunters endlessly poured from the broken  "}
{"text": "city walls.  “Kim Gong-ja hunter!”  "}
{"text": "We were at the very front.  From here to the Devil King, it was empty. The monsters would come soon, but not now.  “Hurry!”  "}
{"text": "It was a bit ironic.  The Heretic Questioner was on Venomous Snake’s back. Venomous Snake was holding Sword Saint’s  arm. Sword Saint had his hand on Crusader’s shoulder. Crusader was holding the Witch’s hand.  "}
{"text": "‘...it would be awesome if I took a picture of this and put it online.’  While I was thinking those thoughts, the Witch shouted.  “Hurry! If you don’t grab on we’re leaving you here!”  "}
{"text": "The Witch was extending her hand towards me.  ‘Ahh.’  And I realized.  "}
{"text": "This scene would be gone soon.  Even the argument Sword Saint and I had.  "}
{"text": "How the Sword Saint pulled back his sword.  And how he bowed his head towards me, apologizing.  How Heretic Questioner had killed those innocent hunters.  Them fighting each other.  "}
{"text": "‘Tt’ Ll all disappear.’  Everything.  "}
{"text": "Like the rain that was pouring.  “Those people won’t remember.’  "}
{"text": "However.  -What are you doing. Partner.  "}
{"text": "That was okay.  -You have to go get the monsters, kid.  It wouldn’t disappear just because it wasn’t remembered.  "}
{"text": "I had a sword.  This place had someone who died on the 1st floor. There was a ghost who died on the 99th floor. No  one knew about their deaths. But we two were still here.  "}
{"text": "“...0kay.”  If we returned, nothing would be solved.  "}
{"text": "Sword Saint would doubt me, and the hunters would suspect each other when it became time to choose  rewards.  "}
{"text": "“Let’s go.”  But I was a bit stronger. I wouldn’t let innocent people die. I wouldn’t watch by while the Count died  and our connection with the outside was cut off. Now I even somewhat knew who the betrayer was.  "}
{"text": "I was sure.  I would do better.  "}
{"text": "“Good!”  The Witch tightly held my hand.  “Teleport!”  "}
{"text": "The next moment, we jumped down from mid-air. The five of us landed at the same time. In front of us,  the Devil King was standing with his sword.  "}
{"text": "-Amusing.  The Devil King was a sword.  "}
{"text": "He was like a shadow in the form of a human.  -Warriors of the goddess, I see.  He had a face but no expression. He had arms, but no hands. He had legs, but no feet, and it seemed  "}
{"text": "like he would fall over any moment.  No. He was actually falling. The Devil King’s body continued to flow down.  "}
{"text": "The owner of nightmares.  The moving shadow.  "}
{"text": "-Warriors. Did you know there’s a betrayer among you? You know, but you’re still trying to trust each  other.  "}
{"text": "Was there any reason to listen more?  As far as I could see, there was none.  "}
{"text": "I ran with my one sword.  “Kim Gong-ja?!”  I heard a surprised voice behind me.  "}
{"text": "“No! Wait! You can’t go by yourself! Everyone has to work together to-”  Sorry.  I’ll see you in my next life.  "}
{"text": "Although you won’t remember today.  -Oho.  "}
{"text": "The Devil King smiled at me running alone at him.  -How foolish.  It was a strange smile. There weren’t any eyes or mouth on his face, so it seemed like he was flowing  "}
{"text": "from his skin.  -Did you come to kill me, warrior?  "}
{"text": "He swung his sword.  It was something I never would’ve been able to block.  Before the sword arrived at my neck.  "}
{"text": "“No.”  I didn’t pretend to block the attack.  It was unnecessary.  "}
{"text": "Instead, I politely raised my middle finger.  “T came to be killed. You son of a bitch.”  "}
{"text": "I’ll see you in my next life too.  It was short, but I definitely saw the Devil King’s smile harden.  "}

{"text": "-Do you want me to read them now?  “Yes, please.’  -Okay!  "}

{"text": "Not in a good way.  He had probably ignored the despair and hate of the dolls and just cleared through them.  Wouldn’t the tower have considered that a shame?  "}

{"text": "‘T’ll go with this.’  -Huh?  Was my choice unexpected?  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong tilted his head.  -You’re going with that? Mm? I don’t know.  "}

{"text": "It wasn’t just the Witch. All the ladders of the large clans looked up at me with various expressions.  Even the Count, who had died from the Devil King’s attack on the 12th floor, was faintly smiling at  "}
{"text": "me.  I had returned to the cafe on the 1st floor, where I made a deal with the guild masters.  ‘A day.’  "}
{"text": "I realized how long 24 hours was.  It was vertiginous.  "}
{"text": "We had begun a new age, cleared the 11th floor, and fought against the Devil King on the 12th floor in  a day. But holy cow. It had all happened in less than a day.  "}
{"text": "“~..yes. The 11th floor will open in a bit.”  I was a bit choked up.  I lightly coughed, and spoke.  "}
{"text": "“T have to start preparing now if I don’t want to fall behind.”  “How are you going to prepare when you don’t know what the 11th floor is like?”  There wasn’t any problem on the 11th floor.  "}
{"text": "It started from the 12th floor, when the Devil King began to interfere.  There, you guys will split up.  "}
{"text": "Someone will betray you, and someone will fall apart from that betrayal.  There’s even someone who dies.  "}
{"text": "“,. Kim Gong-ja?”  The Witch furrowed her eyebrows.  "}
{"text": "“Are you alright? Your face turned strange. Are you feeling okay?”  “Mm. I’m alright. It was just a bit touching to be here with amazing people who lead guilds.”  I casually answered her.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong silently watched me.  “Anyways, yes. You’re right. Everyone. I know what the 11th floor is like. Not only that, I know what  the quest is.”  "}
{"text": "The look in their eyes changed.  "}
{"text": "Information was as important as someone’s life. I had basically said, ‘I know something about your life  at stake.’ It was understandable they would pale.  “T was given the information as a reward for clearing the 10th floor.”  "}
{"text": "“_..and the reason why I’m saying that now.”  The Witch opened her mouth to speak.  “Can we take it that you’re going to share it with us?”  "}
{"text": "“Of course.”  I lifted my forefinger.  "}
{"text": "“However, there’s a condition.”  “Go ahead. We’ Il gladly listen to it.”  “Please do me a favor when I ask for it sometime.”  "}
{"text": "I looked at each of the hunters sitting around the table. They all looked like they were deep in thought.  A favor. It was something easy, but also hard.  “What kind of favor is it?”  "}
{"text": "“T can’t tell you right now.”  “However, I can assure you that it won’t put your life in danger. It’s not about money either. I won’t ask  "}
{"text": "for you to take someone’s life. If you think this is impossible, just refuse me then.”  “Mm.”  Heretic Questioner stroked his chin.  "}
{"text": "With the right hand that was cut off by the Sword Saint last time.  "}
{"text": "“Sounds fine to me. To be honest, I really like that condition! Ahaha. There is almost nothing that can  take you by surprise if you have information about it beforehand. I agree!”  “Hm. If we can refuse...I also agree.”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner and the Count approved.  When the other hunters all finished organizing their thoughts, they promised that they would accept my  condition.  "}
{"text": "‘Nice.’  1 thing done.  "}
{"text": "“Then I’ll say it now. From the 11th floor to the 20th floor, it takes place in a world called the Aegim  Empire. It’s receiving the attack of the Devil King, and the 11th floor is...”  "}
{"text": "My voice quietly echoed in the cafe.  The guild masters all started to murmur after hearing what I said.  “ ..Hm. It was a tutorial up to the 10th floor. And we’ll be thrown into a large scale fight from the 11th  "}
{"text": "floor.”  “Tt’s priceless information, I see.”  “Yup! The fight will also be different now!”  "}
{"text": "“T should give this information to our guild members. Whew. But our Sangryun kids aren’t talented at  all in fighting and...”  "}
{"text": "The hunters shared their opinions.  I nodded my head.  "}
{"text": "‘The 11th floor will be clear more easily with this information now.’  It was already changing. A lot of things had changed since the beginning of this regression.  But it still wasn’t enough.  "}
{"text": "“Then I’ll take my leave now...ah, Crusader.”  “Mm?”  The Crusader turned her head. She was sipping her third Americano now with a straw.  "}
{"text": "“Why did you call for me?”  “You’re the Vice Guild Master of the Civil Militia. Would you like to walk with me? I have something  to discuss with you.”  "}
{"text": "“Hmm.”  "}
{"text": "The Crusader looked around and shrugged her shoulders.  “Well. I was planning on getting up soon anyway. As long as it doesn’t take too long...”  “Tt won’t take that long. 30 minutes is enough.”  "}
{"text": "“Then fine with me.”  The Crusader put her coffee cup down.  "}
{"text": "“T’Il accept the date request.”  3.  "}
{"text": "In the city bustling with people, hunters talked about the 10th floor in benches next to the fountains,  outdoor restaurants, and in markets.  “Seeing as how there hasn’t been any announcement, it was cleared by a nameless newbie!”  "}
{"text": "“No way. The higher guilds are controlling it.”  “Seriously, who did it...”  “T want to clear a stage too.”  "}
{"text": "To those who’s tomorrow was canceled, the subjugation of the 10th floor had just happened.  It felt like I alone was walking in deleted time.  -Hey, Zombie.  "}
{"text": "Well, to be exact, I wasn’t alone.  -He’s following us.  "}
{"text": "Since I had Bae Hu-ryeong.  ‘Are you sure?’  -Definitely. And don’t look back.  "}
{"text": "To safely clear the 12th floor, two things were needed.  One was the alliance with the leaders of the large guilds.  "}
{"text": "And the other...was for Sword Saint to not be hostile towards me.  ‘It’ ll be too late to do it on the 12th floor.’  I had felt it this time.  "}
{"text": "‘Is has to be solved before climbing the tower.’  The relationship between Sword Saint and the guild masters was horrible. If betrayal was added on top  "}
{"text": "of this? We would be taking the shortcut to destruction.  -Dang, I can hardly tell. Look at his stalking skills. You probably won’t be able to tell even if you  turned back. He has a skill related to this.  "}
{"text": "‘I got it, so please just check if it’s following us.’  "}
{"text": "I was baiting the Sword Saint right now.  I had heard about the Sword Saint’s schedule from Bae Hu-ryeong already, and purposely got noticed  by him. After he saw me walk by the outdoor restaurant where he normally ate, he began to follow me.  "}
{"text": "Of course.  “Kim Gong-ja. Where are we going?”  "}
{"text": "The Crusader next to me wouldn’t now.  “There’s only dark and creepy neighborhoods if we go this way...”  “There’s a shop I want to recommend to you.”  "}
{"text": "“Shop?”  “Yes. It’s a shop that a nameless pharmacist runs. It’s amazing. If her name was known, it would get  "}
{"text": "famous right now. But it’s not working out. If you think it’s good, please help with their sales.”  “Mmmmm...”  "}
{"text": "The Crusader looked at my face.  I knew what she was doing.  ‘She activated her Lie Detection skill.’  "}
{"text": "The Crusader opened her mouth.  “Is what you said true?”  "}
{"text": "“Yes. Of course. Why would I lie to you?”  I really was going to introduce her to the store so it wasn’t a lie.  “Are you planning something suspicious?”  "}
{"text": "“I’m trying to receive help from you. Even if something happens, my life will be in danger, not yours.  Trust me.”  "}
{"text": "“Hm.”  She slowly nodded her head.  It was all probably registered as the truth.  "}
{"text": "“Sorry.”  She smiled.  "}
{"text": "“T hear that I’m really doubtful of things quite a lot. Let’s continue.”  Nice. Pass.  "}
{"text": "We passed the street and arrived at the pharmacist’s store. She was moving something that seemed  quite heavy. At first, she tilted her head looking at us approach her, then she smiled brightly when she  saw my face.  "}
{"text": "“Ah! Sir!”  “Are you open now, Store owner-nim?”  "}
{"text": "“Ahaha. It’s closed, but always open for you! You’re my first regular. Hup!”  She put down what she was carrying.  She had looked pretty dirty just a few days ago, but she was completely neat now. She gave off the  "}
{"text": "impression of a store owner now.  “Whew. Ah, sorry. This is...>?”  "}
{"text": "“She’s the hunter that’s working as the Vice Guild Master of the Civil Militia. You’ve heard of her,  right? Her name is Crusader.”  "}
{"text": "“_..pardon?”  Her eyes shook beyond her glasses.  “T, the Vice Guild Master of the Civil Militia?!”  "}
{"text": "“Yup.”  “She’s so high up!”  This was the normal reaction for hunters.  "}
{"text": "“W, why is such a person at this lowly ship...gasp!? Drugs?! Is this to crack down on drugs? I, I didn’t  make any! I’m working in a place like this, but I didn’t touch drugs at the very least, no, I didn’t make  even a gram of anything bad!”  "}
{"text": "“T lived conscientiously! And I’Il continue to do so! So please don’t investigate!”  She bent over flat on the ground.  "}
{"text": "This wasn’t a normal reaction.  “Mm...”  "}
{"text": "The Crusader had an awkward face. Since the Lie Detection had probably said that it was all true. She  seemed to be considering whether she should think of the pharmacist in front of her as a psycho or a  conscious business woman.  "}
{"text": "“Here, here. Store owner-nim. Don’t worry.”  Tap tap.  I patted her shoulder.  "}
{"text": "“T didn’t come here to tattle to the Crusader. You’re such a nice person.”  “Then...2?”  "}
{"text": "“Sales aren’t equal to the quality of your work. So I wanted to introduce it to the Vice Guild Master  here.”  "}
{"text": "The pharmacist lifted her head and dropped her mouth open.  “I, Introduce...?”  “Exactly what it means. Try giving the Crusader different potions to test out. Who knows? She might  "}
{"text": "make a contract with you if she likes it.”  “Wouldn’t it be easier for you if the Civil Militia uses your potions?”  The pharmacist blinked.  "}

{"text": "Someone stepped into the quiet street. The footsteps were pretty heavy, so the three of us all turned our  heads to look.  "}
{"text": "“-there.”  The owner of the footsteps was wearing black formal attire.  “Could everyone else except for that guy step aside?”  "}
{"text": "And he glared at me coldly.  Sword Saint.  "}
{"text": "He was the old man of this regression that didn’t believe me yet.  His low voice rang in the alley.  “T want to speak with that person alone.”  "}

{"text": "“Sword Saint...?”  The Crusader frowned her forehead.  “What are you doing here?”  "}
{"text": "She probably didn’t expect to meet him in this small alley. It was an unexpected place and person. It  didn’t seem to be a coincidence.  "}
{"text": "“A young lady is already having problems with hearing.”  The old man was exuding a murderous intent towards me.  “T’m sure I said to move. I have something to do with the guy over there.”  "}
{"text": "“Are you saying that you want to speak alone with the Kim Gong-ja hunter?”  “Huh. I’m not interested in his name.”  The atmosphere of the alley changed.  "}
{"text": "The Crusader didn’t frown anymore. She was expressionlessly glared at the Sword Saint. Her guard  was definitely up.  "}
{"text": "“Move.”  Sword Saint spoke.  “T already said to move 3 times.”  "}
{"text": "“What doesn’t make sense three times wouldn’t make sense even after 30 times. Sword Saint. Did you  lose your sense with your age?”  The Crusader grabbed her sword.  "}
{"text": "“Kim Gong-ja hunter already joined the five guilds, along with the Civil Militia. | don’t know what  you’re thinking but...don’t think that the Civil Militia will stay still.”  "}
{"text": "“Hal”  The Sword Saint snorted.  "}
{"text": "“T knew it. The guilds were all working together. I knew it.”  “_,.working together. I don’t know what you’re trying to say.”  The atmosphere became worse as time passed.  "}
{"text": "“Sword Saint. I know because it was already reported that you hunt humans. Of course, if it’s  something according to your morals, I won’t say much. But it’s different if you’re planning to do that  right in front of me.”  "}
{"text": "“Different?”  “T’l stop it with my life.”  "}
{"text": "“Are you confident you can do that?”  “No.”  "}
{"text": "The Crusader looked at the Sword Saint expressionlessly.  “T’m going to fight with all my strength, and die. And the moment I die, you’! be someone who killed  an innocent player. Sword Saint. If you want to live the rest of your life as a murderer, be my guest.”  "}
{"text": "“The life that you don’t have long to live. I’ll show you.”  The Sword Saint’s old face crumpled.  "}
{"text": "It was already evening. The sun set quickly in the alley. I could feel people walking here and there  along the alley, but no one was here except for us. It was silent.  "}
{"text": "“Yeah.”  I brought the Crusader here to make this kind of silence.  ‘Sword Saint is weak to innocent people.’  "}
{"text": "And Crusader was probably the only innocent people of the large guilds.  When the Sword Saint tried to kill me in the last regression, the Crusader got in between Sword Saint  "}
{"text": "and me.  -Ms.Crusader.  "}
{"text": "-You’re the only person here who hasn’t hurt anyone. Fine. I’ ll trust you.  It was what he said in passing.  That meant.  "}
{"text": "‘The kill count of the Crusader is [0].’  Even the Sword Saint had violent morals...no. Because he had those standards, the Crusader would  seem like an even better person.  "}
{"text": "‘The Sword Saint won’t ever be able to hurt Crusader.’  To evil people, he was a murderer, but to good people, he was a harmless old man.  "}
{"text": "And...  ‘It’s not just the Crusader.’  "}
{"text": "Someone walked next to us. It was the pharmacist. At the appearance of the Sword Saint and Crusader,  she was hesitating, and she spread her arms out.  "}
{"text": "“E, excuse me.”  The pharmacist spoke. Even her chin was trembling probably because she was so nervous. She bit her  "}
{"text": "lips several times and finally managed to speak.  “T don’t know what it’s about...but the c, customer here! He’s my savior!”  The future Lord of Alchemy spoke as fiercely as she could.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s not like there’s laws in Babylon like the outside world but...protecting a customer is 0, obvious...  and even though you’re the Sword Saint! I can’t forgive you if you touch a customer here!”  "}
{"text": "“A few days ago gangsters made a mess and I was in trouble! Sorry, but please leave from here!”  The pharmacist shouted. If she went against the Sword Saint, she would’ve died in a second. But he  was still weak to her.  "}
{"text": "It was for the same reason.  ‘Saintess. Crusader. Lord of Alchemy Castle.’  "}
{"text": "These three hunters were famous for being kind.  ‘Even when the Flame Emperor was in the slums, the Lord of Alchemy Castle arrived first.’  Kind people.  "}
{"text": "They were always on the short side, and received more stress than other people.  But the only people who could stop Sword Saint were...kind people like them.  “What are you going to do?”  "}
{"text": "The Crusader spoke.  “If you want to make a mess, go ahead.”  The Sword Saint hesitated. If I was right, the result was already decided.  "}
{"text": "And, I was right.  Not too long after, the old sword user pulled his sword back.  "}
{"text": "“_..Today’s not the day.”  The Sword Saint took his murderous aura back.  "}
{"text": "Even when he was walking back, he was glaring at me.  “T hope we don’t meet again. If he didn’t have anything to do with you, his head would be on the  floor.”  "}
{"text": "Good.  Stage 2 clear.  "}
{"text": "With this, the Sword Saint wouldn’t swing his sword at me anytime. Even if he killed me, I would have  the opportunity to speak.  "}
{"text": "“Sword Saint!”  Before the old man completely turned away, I shouted.  “T’Il be waiting in the empty field tomorrow morning!”  "}
{"text": "“You can come if you want to. I’ll be waiting. Really! If you want to know what kind of human I am,  come tomorrow morning!”  The old man turned his head around to glare at me. He examined my face with his blue eyes. But that  "}
{"text": "was it. Without any particular response, he headed back out of the alley.  Once his heavy footsteps couldn’t be heard anymore, the Crusader sighed.  “Whew! That was close. To meet a murderer tonight.”  "}
{"text": "Murderer.  “ .is the Sword Saint famous for being a murderer?”  "}
{"text": "“Not famous. But the five Guild Masters know well.”  The Crusader shook her head.  “T heard he lost his daughter to a murderer outside of the tower.”  "}
{"text": "“Because of that, the Sword Saint doesn’t let go of murderers. He’s ridiculously tough. Well, we didn’t  have any evidence, so we were just watching...mm. And this is obviously a secret.”  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong got in front of me.  -Yeah. Grandpops Marcus told me that once before. His daughter and son-in-law were killed by a serial  "}
{"text": "killer. His grandchildren barely survived.  ‘Why are you saying that now?’  -Huh? What are you talking about? You never asked.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong spoke shamelessly.  Yeah. He was always like this.  "}
{"text": "“Well. It’s not like I don’t understand the Sword Saint.”  The Crusader looked around bitterly.  In the empty alley, the evening sun cast shadows of the buildings.  "}
{"text": "“Working at the Civil Militia, you meet murderers. Sometimes, there are times when you think that  they were justified in killing...even I’m tempted sometimes as well.”  "}
{"text": "The Crusader mumbled.  “All the guild masters have a behind story. Kim Gong-ja. Since you’re with us now, you’!I see that  there are disgusting bits about us. How you’ll react...mm.”  "}
{"text": "She shook her head. Was it because she thought she said too many things to an outsider?  “We got off subject.”  She intentionally spoke in a brighter voice.  "}
{"text": "“So, how much is the potion here? The Civil Militia is also not funded well so it’s a bit tricky if it’s too  expensive but...”  "}
{"text": "4.  The next day.  I looked at my phone by myself in the empty field.  "}
{"text": "There was really not a single soul here. It was obvious. The hunters of Babylon were all in the square  having a festival.  "}
{"text": "It was similar to the last regression.  ‘But there’s something that’s different.’  I looked at the news popping up on my phone.  "}
{"text": "-[Breaking] 11th floor, guild attack? Black Dragon gathering all their members.  -Guilds creating teams to clear...  -Heretic Questioner interview! “You have to have a team for the 11th floor.”  "}
{"text": "-Source of the information is a puzzle...  "}
{"text": "That was right.  The world had changed a little.  Because of me.  "}
{"text": "And it was going to change again.  “Hmm.”  "}
{"text": "Sword Saint walked in from the other side. The sky behind him looked extra blue. People were  shouting from the direction of the city.  "}
{"text": "[00:01:31]  The clock of light was floating up in the air.  A blue sky, people’s voices, and a clock of light.  "}
{"text": "Sword Saint was walking towards me with all that behind him.  “You’re really alone.”  Sword Saint stopped.  "}
{"text": "“Ts this the confidence to be able to stand against me by yourself? Well, I guess if you’re a murderer  that did all that, you would be confident.”  "}
{"text": "His eyes when he was looking at me felt completely new. It was completely different from last time.  It was because there were acknowledgment and respect in his life last time.  But right now, there was none of that.  "}
{"text": "Enmity. Hostility.  It was like he was looking at a murderer.  -Zombie?  "}
{"text": "-Are you alright?  I nodded inwardly.  "}
{"text": "‘I’m good.’  I was just a bit hurt.  “Sword Saint.”  "}
{"text": "I folded my thoughts.  “T have something I want to say to you.”  "}
{"text": "“Go ahead. If it’s your will, I’ll listen to it.”  “IT know why you’re being like this.”  The Sword Saint lifted a corner of his mouth.  "}
{"text": "“T see. You know your own fault.”  “Tt’s because of the skill you have.”  "}
{"text": "The Sword Saint’s face hardened.  “How do you...?”  "}
{"text": "“Please believe what I’m going to say.”  I thought of how hard it was to get someone’s trust as I said that.  "}
{"text": "Everyone had their stubbornness. For the Sword Saint, it was his [Detective’s Insight] skill. The skill  that showed someone’s kill count. The Sword Saint looked down at you if his skill said so.  "}
{"text": "That was why it was his stubbornness.  He lived according to that stubbornness.  The moment he threw away that stubbornness, he would throw away his lifestyle.  "}
{"text": "“You have to convince people like that.’  And I had to make him trust me.  I needed to make him ignore the lifestyle that he lived until now.  "}
{"text": "Thinking about it now, I realized how hard it was.  ‘But..I can do it.’  I clenched my fist.  "}
{"text": "‘I can just put my life on the line as well.’  I opened my mouth.  "}
{"text": "“Sword Saint-nim. I’m a prophet.”  “What?”  "}
{"text": "“T have a skill that’s similar to prophesying things. That’s how I know you have that skill. If I stay like  this, you’ ll kill me, and I’ll ask why you had to kill me.”  “Then, you said that you have a skill called [Detective’s Insight], and there’s a number called [4093]  "}
{"text": "above my head.”  It was a small lie.  "}
{"text": "But I needed to convince him even by lying.  [00:00:00]  The clock in the sky was turning to zero. Fireworks exploded. I could hear cheers.  "}
{"text": "The old man and me.  We just looked at each other.  "}
{"text": "After a silence, the Sword Saint spoke.  “-suess.”  “What?”  "}
{"text": "“I’m hiding my left hand behind my back. And I’m holding up some of my fingers. Tell me how many  fingers I’m holding up. “  "}
{"text": "Okay.  So that’s how he was coming out.  I expected this.  "}
{"text": "“If you can’t guess, I’1l know that you’re ly...”  The Sword Saint was probably getting ready to attack.  "}
{"text": "But he didn’t expect something like this.  Before the Sword Saint could speak, I got out a dagger. Without any hesitation, I cut my throat.  “What?!”  "}
{"text": "The Sword Saint’s eyes widened.  He had only attacked others his entire life. He wouldn’t have expected that I would cut my neck.  Because of that 1 second, I was able to kill myself.  "}
{"text": "And.  [You have died. ]  "}
{"text": "[You are regressing to 24 hours ago. ]  1 second was enough for me.  Again, I started my day.  "}
{"text": "I went down from the 10th floor stage and met the large guild members. The Crusader and I walked  into the alley. We met the Sword Saint.  "}
{"text": "[00:00:00]  And time was in this moment again.  "}
{"text": "“guess.”  It was the same test as my last regression.  But my reaction wasn’t the same as last time. Instead, I spoke like I had expected it before.  "}
{"text": "“You’re trying to hide your left hand behind your back.”  "}
{"text": "“You’re trying to ask me how many fingers you’re lifting up. It’s easy to kill me here. But you can’t  clear the 12th floor stage like this. A lot of people will lose their lives.”  “Wait.”  "}
{"text": "The Sword Saint spoke.  “This isn’t enough. You could have another skill...”  Fine.  "}
{"text": "Once wasn’t enough.  I had already expected this.  "}
{"text": "[You have died. ]  [You are being regressed to 24 hours ago. |  Of course it wouldn’t be easy to convince someone.  "}
{"text": "“That’s not enough evidence. It could be...”  “You’re thinking it could be another skill like clairvoyance or something else.”  But it was okay.  If he wanted to test me, he could continue to do so.  "}
{"text": "[You have died. ]  [You are regressing to 24 hours ago. ]  He could suspect me as much as he wanted.  "}
{"text": "[You have died. ]  [You are regressing to 24 hours ago. ]  "}
{"text": "It didn’t matter if it took a week or a month.  [You have died. ]  [You are regressing to 24 hours ago. ]  "}
{"text": "I was confident I could convince him.  My death is longer than your life.  "}
{"text": "Then, the Sword Saint closed his mouth.  All his suspicions had been answered.  I spoke calmly.  "}
{"text": "“Sword Saint-nim. Please trust me.”  "}
{"text": "“You can’t kill me here. Countless innocent people will die on the 12th floor stage. Really. I’m not  telling you I’m innocent, and I’m not telling you to save me forever.”  “... Then?”  "}
{"text": "“5 days.”  I lifted my fingers.  “Please don’t just kill me for the next few days. Following me, you can judge with your own two eyes  "}
{"text": "if I deserve to die.”  The Sword Saint was silent.  "}
{"text": "I knew that he was hesitating.  The last final blow was needed.  And I knew what the ‘last blow’ was.  "}
{"text": "“You still don’t believe me.”  “You say something to me in the future. You know that I’m really a prophet if I say this.”  “ ..what’s that?”  "}
{"text": "I answered.  “Sword Emperor.”  "}
{"text": "The old man’s eyes widened.  I continued to speak, regardless.  “T don’t know who that is, but you said you would believe me if I said that.”  "}
{"text": "It was silent.  Cheers were still coming from the city far away. I could even see the image of the goddess descending.  When the goddess slowly began to fade away, the old Sword Saint spoke.  "}
{"text": "“5 days. Youngster.”  “Yes.”  "}
{"text": "“Fine.”  The Sword Saint looked into my eyes.  "}
{"text": "“I’m going to follow you for 5 days. I’ll be observing you say and do without missing anything. After  that, I’1l decide whether you’re a prophet or not.”  “Ts this good?”  "}
{"text": "Very.  “_.. Yes. Good. That’s enough.”  "}
{"text": "I bowed my head.  “Thank you, truly.”  All the conditions were cleared.  "}
{"text": "First, getting the promise from the Guild Masters.  Second, stopping the Sword Saint from killing me right away.  Third, having the Sword Saint trust me for a while.  "}
{"text": "‘Finally.’  Now, finally, even if we climbed up to the 12h floor, the Sword Saint and the Guild Masters wouldn’t  "}
{"text": "clash.  Nor would the innocent hunters die.  “Then, Sword Saint. See you on the next stage.”  "}
{"text": "I barely managed to speak through my tight throat.  The Sword Saint was looking at me strangely, but I couldn’t worry about that right now. I had to do  what I had to do.  "}
{"text": "“Transmit.”  White light surrounded me.  "}
{"text": "Feeling my heart beat faster, I thought to myself.  ‘Now all that’s left is to hunt the Devil King.’  The world changed.  "}
{"text": "“Wait. Devil King.’  And it was going to change a bit more.  "}

{"text": "Chapter 36 — My Death Is (3)  Translator: HH  "}
{"text": "The white light settled down.  When I opened my eyes, I was already in the middle of the battlefield.  "}
{"text": "I confidently walked in at the familiar scene.  -Krrrrr, kiiiiek!  Monsters were crying out and soldiers were getting injured while fighting them.  "}
{"text": "Thousands of monsters ran to destroy the port.  The 11th floor.  The first battle to protect the Aegim Empire had begun.  "}
{"text": "“Thank you! I see you’ve come to help us, warriors!”  The general NPC who greeted us was the same as the last regression. He wore the same armor, had the  "}
{"text": "same expression, and said the same lines.  “Warriors! Please save our empire and...”  "}
{"text": "But it was only up to there.  That was the end of the similarities.  At the general’s words, the way the hunters reacted was different.  "}
{"text": "“Gather, Black Dragon!”  A cold voice pierced through the battlefield. It was the owner of Black Dragon, the Witch. Just like in  the battle that only I remembered, the Witch shouted after gathering her Aura. She had something about  "}
{"text": "her that pulled people’s gazes.  “Black Dragon will take the directing right in this war from now!”  The Witch looked at the battlefield.  "}
{"text": "“Chen-mu mun! Civil Militia! Do whatever you need to at the left! Ten Thousand Temple and  Sangryun take the right! Black Dragon will take the center. If anyone has any complaints, let me know  after the battle! If you have time to complain right now, get another orc instead!”  "}
{"text": "The world changed.  "}
{"text": "“OQooowwwwwoo0o000!”  The shouts of the hunters were proof of that.  "}
{"text": "The large guilds moved about in a hurry. Was it because I shared information that this was a team  subjugation?  "}
{"text": "There wasn’t any hunter who stood around blankly.  “Kiddos, follow me! If someone dies before me I’ ll kill you!”  Even the Chen-mu mun that the Venomous Snake was leading.  "}
{"text": "“What are you...never mind. Everyone, back Chen-mu mun up! We have to help those idiots when  they start taking it overboard again!”  Even the Civil Militia, led by the Crusader.  "}
{"text": "“Ahahaha! Acting individually immediately gets you a death sentence. Everyone! Move as a team!”  Even the Ten Thousand Temple, led by the Heretic Questioner.  “Everyone’s so passionate. Let’s take it slowly.”  "}
{"text": "And Sangryun, led by the Count.  There wasn’t a single blind spot amongst the guilds. Everyone focused on what they had to do. Hunters  "}
{"text": "specialized for battles swung their swords, and hunters who specialized in support casted magic from  behind. Like a tsunami, hunters were pushing the monster army behind.  “Ohbhh...!”  "}
{"text": "The general NPC exclaimed in astonishment. Was he touched looking at the view in front of him?  “Clearly the god hasn’t abandoned us! Look! The warriors from the other world are pushing back the  monsters! Soldiers of the empire! We should also fight back! Soldiers, follow me!”  "}
{"text": "The leaders of the squadrons all shouted and ran.  I stepped aside and watched them.  "}
{"text": "Yeah.  What people needed was just a little bit of relief.  "}
{"text": "Even if I just changed a little, if I moved secretly just a bit, the scene of the stage changed like this.  Just then, Bae Hu-ryeong spoke in a low voice.  -Zombie. Are you alright?  "}
{"text": "‘Hm? What?’  -You’ll stand out less this way.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong was frowning.  -There’s no one who likes to stand out more than you. You go crazy for attention. Isn’t the attention  going your way going to decrease like this?  "}
{"text": "“Well. I guess.’  I shrugged my shoulders.  "}
{"text": "‘But this isn’t too bad either.’  -Hoho? I guess you grew a bit.  "}
{"text": "“What do you mean, ‘grow...’ I’m still gonna take what I can get!’  Then, I felt a gaze on my back.  When I tured around, I saw the old Sword Saint looking at me.  "}
{"text": "“Uh.”  I was a bit flustered.  "}
{"text": "“What are you doing there...sir?”  “T was watching you.”  The Sword Saint spoke like it was obvious.  "}
{"text": "“You said so earlier. To decide if I should kill you or not in 5 days. That’s why I’m watching you.”  “ ..Uh. Mm. You’re not really planning on watching me 24/7 for 5 days, right?”  “What a strange question. Of course I am.”  "}
{"text": "Goodness.  What the heck. Was he a stalker?  "}
{"text": "“Wait, you have to get monsters too! The next stage’s rewards will be given based on the level of  contribution!”  “Hm.”  "}
{"text": "Sword Saint lightly swung his sword.  Blue Aura clawed around the entire battlefield. About 20 goblins screamed and their heads fell off.  Blood bloomed everywhere.  "}
{"text": "The Sword Saint turned back to me.  “Don’t worry, I’m planning on using my sword occasionally as well.”  "}
{"text": "“Do whatever you have to do.”  As expected, he was super experienced.  "}
{"text": "His level was completely different.  “Ahew. This.”  "}
{"text": "I shook my head and headed towards the Witch of the Black Dragon. Their guilds members stopped  me, but paused when they saw Sword Saint following me. When the Witch realized that we were  approaching her, she waved her hand and cleared our path.  "}
{"text": "“What’s wrong? Hunter Kim Gong-ja. And even the grandpops.”  She threw a fit with her forehead wrinkled.  "}
{"text": "“I’m busy directing our guild members. I don’t have the time. If you could say what you need to in 30  seconds I’d be grateful.”  “T don’t really have any business with you.”  "}
{"text": "The old man spoke casually.  “T just followed this youngster.”  “What? What the heck does that...never mind. Not interested! I don’t have time to be focused on you  "}
{"text": "right now. This is a request, so if it’s not important, please leave. Hey, you! Team 4!”  Even while rebuking the Sword Saint, she busily gave orders to her guild members.  "}
{"text": "“Stop going forward stupidly and stay there! If you don’t want a spear to land in your ass, stay there!  What’s Team 12 doing? Do you think we’re here for a walk?! Hunt properly!”  "}
{"text": "“S, Sorry! Black Dragon Master!”  “If you have time to be sorry, use your sword in that time instead!”  She really did look busy.  "}
{"text": "I quickly got to the point.  “Black Dragon Master. I have the reward for clearing the 10th floor.”  “Of course you do. So what?”  "}
{"text": "“This mini map is the reward. I can see the entire battlefield with this map. And allies and enemies are  marked. I can even see where the enemies’ forces are.”  "}
{"text": "Then the Witch turned her head to look me right in the eye.  “Really?”  “Why would I lie. It’s real.”  "}
{"text": "“Then why didn’t you tell me sooner!”  She grabbed my right hand.  "}
{"text": "“Speak! Where is the boss monster! ?”  I guess this person showed her real self when she was super busy.  “Mm. There.”  "}
{"text": "I pointed in the direction that the mini map marked.  “Tt’s surrounded by monsters but there-”  "}
{"text": "“Say that you agree to the use of my skill! Quick!”  “Uh, I agree with the use of Black Dragon Master’s skill.”  “Teleport!”  "}
{"text": "The next moment, the Witch and I were floating in mid air. To be exact, we were falling. In the middle  of the battlefield, monsters and humans were busily fighting.  "}
{"text": "The Witch’s black hair flew in the air as she shouted.  “Where! 2”  “There!”  "}
{"text": "I shouted because of the sound of the wind.  “Where I’m pointing-”  “Teleport!”  "}
{"text": "Everytime the Witch shouted for her Teleport skill, we rapidly became closer to where the boss monster  was. I hugged the Witch tighter in the air. It didn’t mean much. I just thought that if only our hands  were touching I’d immediately fall from the sky.  "}
{"text": "Like she understood, she didn’t object. And she shouted with her eyes narrowed.  “Are you confident in using your sword?!”  "}
{"text": "“Enough to kill the boss monster here!”  “Then I’ll send you on top of the boss monster! So in one! Okay!?”  “Yes, ma’am!”  "}
{"text": "I knew well what she was saying.  “Teleport!”  "}
{"text": "When the last teleportation was finished, we flew right above the boss monster.  There were about 10 meters left to go.  Around the boss monsters, goblins were shouted annoyingly. It was hard to believe that was how they  "}
{"text": "directed their monster army.  “Kim Gong-ja!”  "}
{"text": "“Yaaaaaaaaa!”  I covered my body with Aura and shouted. Did they hear us? The head goblin that was directing the  "}
{"text": "monsters tilted his head to look up.  -Korrrk?  The head goblin and I made eye contact.  "}
{"text": "But it was already too late.  My blade landed right on top of the head goblin’s head. His body was split into two. He was a boss  monster, but he couldn’t even fight back. He just looked at me until the very end like he felt wronged.  "}
{"text": "Well, I guess since he had been killed by me twice, he would feel wronged.  -Kerrrk...  -K, rr...?  "}
{"text": "The monsters who had suddenly lost their leaders looked at me blankly. It seemed like they couldn’t  understand what had happened because it had happened so fast.  "}
{"text": "I grinned at them.  “What?”  "}
{"text": "Stepping on the body of the head goblin.  “You want to be cut into half too>?”  The monsters belatedly screamed.  -Korrirk! Krrr!?  "}
{"text": "Unimportant little things like goblins and orcs quickly scattered. When one ran away, the other quickly  began to run away, and soon, 30 of them were running away. They began running away like they were  dominoes falling apart.  "}
{"text": "“Let’s go!”  Next to me, the Witch clenched her small fists.  "}
{"text": "“Good job, Kim Gong-ja! Goodness! It seems like we’ll be able to clear the stage in less than an hour!  Less than 50 hunters will probably have died. Maybe even 30... Ah! It can’t get better than this!”  "}
{"text": "It was the first time I saw the Witch so excited.  Was the reason why she was so expressionless in the last chap because...a lot of hunters had died at the  beginning because they didn’t know what to do? And she was happy because the damage was less this  "}
{"text": "time?  ‘She’s unexpectedly quite simple.’  "}
{"text": "Someone who was sad or happy based on the number of sacrifices.  I smiled.  "}
{"text": "“Now now, you’re too excited right now. Calm down a bit.”  “You have to be excited when you’re feeling excited! [’1l compliment you again. Good job, Kim Gong-  ja! There’s never been a case when the sacrifices to clear a stage have been this low. You can brag  "}

{"text": "‘Tt worked!’  It was completely different from how he immediately lifted his sword to look at me.  ‘Tt finally worked!’  "}

{"text": "“Yesterday?”  “The favor.”  I answered the Heretic Questioner’s question.  "}
{"text": "“T asked for you to do me a favor sometime.”  “Ah, yes! Of course I remember!”  "}
{"text": "“Tt would be nice if you could do that favor for me right now.”  I slowly looked at the hunters.  The Guild Masters were all listening closely at the word ‘favor.’  "}

{"text": "It was when the tutorial of the tower was finished.  -Warriors.  -Those climbing the tower.  "}
{"text": "The hunters had counted down with all their might in the square. And the goddess had descended in  that square. The goddess spoke seriously like she was an apostle praying.  "}
{"text": "-From the 11th floor to the 20th floor.  -You will be met with a test.  "}
{"text": "-A test of faith.  The hunters didn’t listen to the goddess’s voice.  A new era. A new stage.  "}
{"text": "They were excited because a new stage was opened, and immediately left for the 11th floor. There was  even a hunter who had tested if the goddess could be cut with a sword.  "}

{"text": "I didn’t do that.  I stayed until the end.  "}

{"text": "The question wasn’t which award we would choose, or who we would suspect. The tower just let us  know that our answer would be of importance.  "}
{"text": "-May luck be with you.  The goddess was quietly praying.  At this moment, I arrived on the 12th floor again.  "}

{"text": "It was dead silent.  The first person to speak was the Black Dragon Master.  “Wait. 5 days...?”  "}
{"text": "She looked confused.  “Did I hear something wrong? I think you just said that you would clear up to the 20th floor in 5 days.  "}
{"text": "If that was supposed to be a joke, that wasn’t funny, so take it back.”  “No, you heard right. And it’s not a joke.”  The Witch shut her mouth.  "}
{"text": "The silence in the reception room turned to low murmuring. The faces of the hunters changed. Some  looked like they were flabbergasted, some looked like they couldn’t believe it, and others looked like  they didn’t know how to react.  "}
{"text": "‘This kind of reaction is obvious.’  I calmly took in all their gazes.  "}
{"text": "Because it was an announcement that didn’t make sense even if you thought about it logically.  “_..That’s impossible. Kim Gong-ja.”  A moment later, the Witch spoke.  "}
{"text": "“You know. It took us years to clear just until the 10th floor. Of course, since we cleared the 11th floor  in less than an hour, you might be flowing with confidence but...it’s too much. You’re overconfident.  Aren’t you a bit too excited?”  "}
{"text": "“Black Dragon Master.”  I bowed my head.  “It’s my request.”  "}
{"text": "“T cleared the 10th floor. I didn’t do it for you. I cleared it because I wanted to succeed. However, I still  shared the rewards of the 10th floor with everyone.”  "}

{"text": "“Tt’s simple! Kim Gong-ja has shared information about the 11th floor with us. In return, he asked us to  do a favor for him, and we promised to do it as long as it’s not impossible!”  The Heretic Questioner beamed.  "}

{"text": "The other hunters all agreed as well. The Witch and the Heretic Questioner. The influential hunter and  the most psychotic hunter had agreed. Even the hunters who weren’t Guild Masters ended up agreeing  and promised 5 days of silence.  "}

{"text": "I opened the large door of the reception room and left.  There was a large palace beyond the door. Past the palace, there were high walls, and beyond the walls,  there was the city of the Aegim Empire.  "}

{"text": "But it was different.  -Huh? The NPCs are all standing still?  "}

{"text": "Time was paused.  I walked down the paused street.  Far behind, Sword Saint was coming too.  "}
{"text": "-Quest?  “Yes. No one has chosen their [Role] yet.’  "}
{"text": "In the empire right now, there was no chancellor or grand master of knights.  Even though they were important figures that were needed.  This was the quest of the 12th to the 20th floor.  "}
{"text": "‘As soon as we entered the 11th floor, the quest was given. That’s probably the right order. But didn’t  we already arrive here some time ago? Why would it take so long for the quest to be given?’  "}
{"text": "The quest opened after the roles were chosen.  That meant.  "}
{"text": "‘If no roles are chosen, the quest won’t begin, either. The Devil King’s attack won’t begin, and the  empire soldiers won’t fight against it.’  That was why the NPCs were still.  "}
{"text": "And they would continue to be like that.  ‘In this world, we don’t choose a role.’  "}
{"text": "It was a kind of trigger.  When the highest subjugators chose a role, the quest would begin.  ‘But you know that, Sword Emperor.’  "}
{"text": "I crossed the streets. Because there were passersby, I twisted around them to move by them. It was like  walking through a maze.  "}
{"text": "Even while walking through the maze made of people, notifications continued to ring in my head.  [The Devil King of Rall Rain advises you to choose a reward. |  I ignored it.  "}
{"text": "[The Devil King of Fall Rain advises you to give it up if you aren’t going to choose a reward. In that  case, the ability to choose a reward moves onto the next subjugator. ]  I ignored it and continued to walk.  "}

{"text": "-What?  I could see it.  A sparkling red dot that was clear on the half-transparent map.  "}
{"text": "There was only 1 red dot at this point when no monsters were summoned.  ‘I said, what do you think will happen if the boss monster dies before the quest starts.’  The Devil King.  "}

{"text": "-What...  “Look. This is the best choice.”  "}
{"text": "In this time when the quest didn’t begin yet.  And the city wasn’t attacked by the Devil King yet.  So, it was a world where no one had died.  "}

{"text": "“Did you understand? It’s a happy ending without any sacrifices.”  I smirked.  “T never really liked bad endings. Is it because of my personality? I like happy endings more. You were  "}

{"text": "Even when we were talking, the light rain continued to whirl around.  “Huh?”  "}

{"text": "I subconsciously muttered.  “History changes...”  “What?”  "}
{"text": "“History changed.”  The numbers of guards around the city walls noticeably decreased as well.  Not only did their numbers change, but their expressions also changed.  "}
{"text": "Their faces weren’t filled with fear and despair of the Devil King’s presence. They looked like they  were bored with their jobs.  "}

{"text": "Next to me, the Witch was silent. That was how violent the screams of the Devil King were.  It was an intense murderous intent.  Even the Sword Saint took a step back and tightened his grip on his sword.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s a horrendous scream.”  The Sword Saint murmured.  "}
{"text": "“T’ve never heard of a voice like that. It sounds like he has a thousand mouths.”  “Yeah. Why is he shouting like that...>?”  "}

{"text": "-Huh?  Bae Hu-ryeong only tilted his head calmly.  -What’s with that guy?  "}
{"text": "And he said totally unexpected words.  -He’s weaker than before.  ‘Pardon?’  "}
{"text": "-He’s a lot weaker than when he was fighting on the floor below this.  He was a lot weaker.  I slowly observed the Devil King.  "}
{"text": "‘... That?’  -Yeah.  Bae Hu-ryeong wrinkled his eyes.  "}
{"text": "-Since he was cut by the Witch or whatever her name is. It’s obvious that he would be injured. But it’s  not just an injury and...his [Level] completely dropped.’  "}
{"text": "‘His level dropped?’  -Mm. How do I say this? For example...  Bae Hu-reyong carefully thought about his words.  "}
{"text": "-Yeah. Let’s compare him to a head king goblin. That guy was like an SSS Class head goblin that was a  combination of Alexander and Arthur, with a goblin.  "}
{"text": "“You’re metaphors are becoming even more innovative. How do you know Alexander and Arthur?’  -An emperor should know about the great ones before him.  ‘Ah, sure. Let’s go with that, Sword Emperor.’  "}
{"text": "I spoke inwardly.  ‘So the Devil King on the 12th floor was that kind of SSS Class head king goblin but...’  "}
{"text": "-Yeah. He’s kinda like just a head king goblin with the SSS Class tag taken off. And not the head king  goblin that was leading the 11th floor army, but the weak head king goblin you cowardly gorked and  krred at to defeat.  "}
{"text": "In the tower’s time, it happened a few days before.  But as Bae Hu-ryeong referenced something that was a far-off incident to remember, he tilted his head.  -Hu! That’s strange. Bosses have to become stronger as they climb the tower usually. But why did that  "}
{"text": "happen? Did the Witch’s attack have some kind of level down effect earlier?  Listening to the Sword Emperor speak, I looked around.  It was an empty temple.  "}

{"text": "‘...Could it be...’  His appearance gave me a bit of assurance.  "}
{"text": "‘Did something unexpected happen to the stage?’  It was then.  [Calculating the 12th floor clear rewards. ]  [Calculation impossible! ]  "}

{"text": "It was a map.  However, it was completely different from maps that I saw up until now.  [All maps from the 11th floor to the 20th floor are being opened! ]  "}
{"text": "It was a world map.  Like its namesake, the map that was given to me on the floor below was a ‘mini map.’ Even if it was  big, it was limited to a single floor usage. But the map in front of me was on a completely different  "}
{"text": "level.  It was a map of this world, a map of Another World.  I began seeing a ‘world map.’  "}
{"text": "As soon as I saw the map, I realized.  “T figured it out!”  "}
{"text": "“Hm?”  The Sword Saint and the Witch looked at me at the same time. The Witch had a questioning face, and  the Sword Saint had an indifferent face.  "}
{"text": "“Figured...what out?”  “Why the Devil King is being like that. Black Dragon Master. Think of the last stage.”  I spoke quickly.  "}
{"text": "“The history of the Devil King’s attack disappeared. And the cities are completely different. Things like  the refugees shelters are completely gone.”  "}
{"text": "“So what...?”  “Sheesh, think about it logically. Where would the refugees have come from? From the rural villages in  "}
{"text": "the empire, no, probably from across the entire continent. But the refugee shelters where those people  were completely disappeared.”  eeadulle?  "}
{"text": "The Witch finally looked like she caught onto something.  “T see.”  She narrowed her eyes.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s not just the empire’s history that changed. All the other refugees from across the empire...”  “Yes.”  I nodded my head.  "}
{"text": "“Not just the empire, but the entire continent changed. We returned to the time before the Devil King  attacked!”  "}
{"text": "Yes.  “And now!”  "}
{"text": "That was what happened.  “And we’re at the point when this temple was being attacked!”  Seeing the world map, I became sure.  "}
{"text": "The continent of this world was divided by mountains. The mountains were so high that you had to risk  your life to climb them. But in between the mountains, there was a small area. People could pass by  this area to get to opposite sides of the continent.  "}
{"text": "This temple was located right in that area.  A temple that connected the east and the west. There would probably be a long history and countless  "}
{"text": "legacies about this.  This temple was the shield of the goddess.  "}
{"text": "Inside the shield, there was a large horizon to the east. Small lands were in the field, and beyond that,  there was an empire. Past the empire, there was only the ocean, so the empire’s borders started on the  plains and ended on plains.  "}
{"text": "On the other west side, it was completely red.  All the land beyond the goddess’s shield was stained red. It was the Devil King’s land.  "}
{"text": "The Devil King had broken through this shield to plough through the east. And at the end, he had  pushed them back until the port.  That was how history was supposed to go.  "}
{"text": "‘So this is what ‘history changing’ means!’  I understood.  "}
{"text": "The time of this world was going backwards.  History changing.  It might’ve been more appropriately called [History Regression. ]  "}
{"text": "-Keahhhhh!  Yes.  "}
{"text": "Why the Devil King was crying out like that, and why the Sword Emperor said the Devil King’s level  had fallen.  I could completely understand it now.  "}
{"text": "I muttered inwardly.  ‘His level went down.’  "}
{"text": "-What?  Bar Hu-ryeong furrowed his eyebrows.  -Level went down?  "}
{"text": "“Yeah, you know. The voice that we hear when hunters climb a level.’  There was.  There was a chosen voice that hunters heard when they became stronger.  "}
{"text": "[Your existence has become even clearer. ]  [Your level is growing. ]  Bae Hu-reyong probably thought of the same voice as me.  "}
{"text": "-Are you talking about the ‘your being’ thing?  “Yes, exactly!’  "}
{"text": "It was easy to understand what ‘your level growing’ meant. But it was confusing what [Being  becoming clearer] meant. I just thought they were trying to sound fancy but...  "}
{"text": "Looking at the Devil King now, I knew.  “That boss monster probably grew by killing more people. But his murders and hunts became nothing.  And so.”  "}
{"text": "That was why.  “His growth was deleted.”  "}
{"text": "His being was growing faint.  “The path that he took so far...the history of massacres had been erased.”  Because I changed the history of the 12th floor after going through endless battles.  "}
{"text": "-Keaaaaaah!  Every time I took a step forward, the Devil King took a step back.  [The Devil King of Fall Rain is furious. ]  "}
{"text": "[His being is becoming fainter. ]  And the voice that I heard proved that I was right.  "}
{"text": "-You...!  The red nightmare growled.  "}
{"text": "It was the same murderous intent as before.  But no one was pushed back. Not anymore.  "}
{"text": "The Witch, Sword Saint, and I looked the Devil King directly in the eye.  “Let’s go.”  I spoke.  "}
{"text": "“Let’s light the signal fire of counterattack.”  5.  -Hundred Ghosts!  "}
{"text": "Berrrrr!  The Devil King’s body boiled.  "}
{"text": "-Thousand Monsters!  It was a voice that sounded like it was screaming.  -My child!  "}
{"text": "As if replying to that, monsters from all over the stage were raised. It was summoning magic. They had  probably been there from the beginning.  "}
{"text": "From the column of the temple, from the remains of the collapsed building, monsters slowly got up.  -Oooouuuuh.  About a thousand zombies got up.  "}
{"text": "Were they the humans that were in this temple in the past? They were some who wore mitres, and some  who were dressed as paladins.  The Devil King shouted.  "}
{"text": "-Kill them!  The horde of zombies ran at us.  "}

{"text": "-Sure. So you killed the Devil King and saved him with your skill. You even gave it a name......sheesh,  that name. What kind of name is ‘Preta’ for a girl? If you wanted to call it a preta, you should’ve  named her Green Preta and call her Greenie for short.  "}

{"text": "I nodded my head.  -You blocked her way while laughing and saying she wouldn‘t win, right?  “That’s how it started.”  "}
{"text": "—And you erased everything she stacked up. After that, you even blew her mind away with everything  you said.  "}
{"text": "“That’s what happened.”  -And you even killed her. Whew, you forced a kid that didn’t want to come out with Hundred Ghosts  Reincarnation.  "}
{"text": "“That’s how it ended I guess.”  The Sword Emperor clicked his tongue.  -Haaa, you indifferent bastard. Is your heart made of stone?  "}
{"text": "“There might even be a cobra in there. You forgot to talk about the fact that I ‘closed the curtains to the  one who doesn’t even know how to use a sword’ like someone told me to.”  "}
{"text": "-That was necessary, and that preta is probably thankful for that deep inside her heart. If she has the  passion of a sword user still left inside her.  "}
{"text": "The Sword Emperor spoke in a serious tone.  I thought this ghost was just good at nagging, but it seemed like he was also good at talking about  bullshit.  "}
{"text": "-Anyways, so I think it would be normal for her to be angry at you. But why is she bowing her head and  asking for you to command her? Was the disaster that swallowed up a whole world actually a  masochist of the century?  "}
{"text": "The Sword Emperor said that he wanted to get away from us, but the same went for me. I took a step  back.  "}
{"text": "Seriously, that gorilla’s imagination....  “Sword Emperor....the reason why Preta is obeying me...”  "}
{"text": "-The reason is?  “Because Preta knows.”  I looked at Preta.  "}
{"text": "“You’ll know soon enough too.”  Sounds of sobbing rang out in the Acacia field.  “Heuk....ah...heuk...... .  "}

{"text": "[The 20th floor is being revised. ]  Slowly.  "}

{"text": "Preta looked far off into the distance with wet eyes. Something came from the entrance of the Acacia  forest path.  "}
{"text": "Chulkuk! Chulkeduk!  Every time they moved, their armor bumped around. Above them, there were flags of various colors.  “Please....”  "}
{"text": "They were a countless number of soldiers.  There were the footsteps of soldiers and the sound of wings flapping.  “Again, the village....burn the village...”  "}
{"text": "To turn back history.  To burn up paradise.  "}
{"text": "Forces from all around the world were allied together and entered the Acacia forest path.  “No, please....ut, ahh.....”  Preta collapsed to the floor and bowed.  "}
{"text": "Her bowed head and hands were directed at me.  “Lord.....”  Like what the Sword Emperor said, Preta should’ve been trying to tear me to shreds.  "}
{"text": "But the fact that she was bowing desperately towards me probably meant that she was that much  furious and hurt.  "}
{"text": "However, she did it.  She had to.  “T won’t have any grudges.....1 won’t take revenge.....”  "}

{"text": "Not Saying too much.  I began to walk.  "}

{"text": "Murmur murmur.  Some of the soldiers suspiciously glanced at me. The Aegim Imperial Army was gently bowing its  head, but that was all. The soldiers who belonged to other divisions didn’t have a sliver of doubt on  "}

{"text": "The very leader of the Imperial Army carefully examined my complexion.  “Can I ask you a stupid question?”  “What is it?”  "}
{"text": "“The reason we’re here today, as I mentioned before, is to defeat the witch. Why is the emissary of the  Founding Emperor here at this place...>?”  "}
{"text": "I closed my eyes for a moment,  ‘Lying’s all about confidence.’  I exclaimed with my eyes wide open.  "}
{"text": "“Gentlemen from the Imperial Army! I’ve already defeated the witch!”  My aura-filled voice resounded loudly on the Acacia field.  "}
{"text": "General Sarbast Aegim was shocked.  “Hu-, huhhhh? What do you mean you’ve already defeated her, What are you.......  “Look here!”  "}
{"text": "I cleared the way. Then the vengeful ghost who was hiding behind me was revealed. Whether they had  already known about Estelle’s appearance, some recognized her and shouted.  "}
{"text": "“Es-, it’s Estelle!”  “Tt’s the Witch of the West!”  “T’ve seen her before! It’s that woman!”  "}
{"text": "“Burn the witch to death!”  The vengeful ghost’s mouth wailed and flinched.  But I said without a care.  "}
{"text": "“Vengeful Ghost.”  "}
{"text": "A firm command.  The vengeful ghost, who was reduced to becoming a part of my Hundred Ghosts, had no power to  disobey my orders. She stumbled and knelt.  "}
{"text": "That wasn’t the end.  “Bow your head down.”  "}
{"text": "The vengeful ghost bowed her head.  “On the floor.”  "}
{"text": "The vengeful ghost touched the floor with her trembling hands. Was it because of anger? Or was it  because of disgrace? Either way, she couldn’t speak, or she was biting her tongue, the two cheeks of the  ghost had a deep pouted look. A little later, blood fell down her jawline to her lips.  "}
{"text": "“Place your forehead to the ground.”  “Ugh...”  The vengeful ghost followed my orders.  "}
{"text": "The soldiers watched, holding their breath, as the former Devil King bowed her forehead on the  ground. Even more anger and disgrace mingled with the sound of the vengeful ghost’s breath.  Nevertheless, to protect her little paradise, she obeyed my orders.  "}
{"text": "In a way, it was an imposing scene.  To the vengeful ghost, I ordered solemnly.  “Just like that, straining both your feet, kick the floor, and do a forward roll.”  "}
{"text": "Silence.  Silence dawned on the Acacia field for a moment.  "}
{"text": "The vengeful ghost turned her head and looked up at me.  She looked as if she had just heard something wrongly.  "}
{"text": "I frowned.  “Didn’t you hear me?”  “Uh, uh huh...? ”  "}
{"text": "“Go ahead and do a forward roll!”  The vengeful ghost flinched and reluctantly obeyed my orders. That is to say, she placed both her hands  "}
{"text": "on the ground and made a forward roll.  Degoureureu!  [T/N: Korean sound effect of rolling forward. ]  "}
{"text": "A small body rolled down the field, and her blonde hair which was even longer than her body fluttered  away and swept up the acacia petals on the floor. After one such lap, the vengeful ghost still had an  expression as if she didn’t know what or why she just did, what she did.  "}
{"text": "“Hmm.”  I nodded.  "}
{"text": "“Now do a handstand.”  The vengeful ghost looked back at me one more time.  She seemed to doubt the mental state of her new owner.  "}
{"text": "Of course, I didn’t lift even an eyebrow.  “Hurry up, can’t you even do a handstand?!”  “Hikkk.”  "}
{"text": "The vengeful ghost trembled and touched the floor with both her hands. And as she slowly tried to do a  handstand, “Ackkk!” perhaps she didn’t have enough strength, but she stumbled and fell. “Sobs  sobs...” As if swimming on the bare ground, the vengeful ghost was floundering in tears.

{"text": "Either way, I continued to order in a stern voice.  “Do twenty jumping jacks!”  "}
{"text": "“Ten squats, start!”  “10 push-ups as soon as you’re done!”  “T order you to do 20 sit-ups!”  "}
{"text": "“Stay in the plank position for 20 seconds!”  After a while.  "}
{"text": "“No, no more, Lord...I, I can’t move my body...”  The former Devil King didn’t have the power to lift even a finger and laid down on the floor.  "}

{"text": "“Do you understand now?”  Sarbast Aegim had his mouth wide open. Not only the general but also the soldiers under his command  "}
{"text": "had a similar expression. The Continent’s army looked dazedly at the vengeful ghost, who was crying  like a mere child.  “Ho-, holy emissary. What exactly is this......  "}
{"text": "“As I just said.”  I widened my eyes and stared fearlessly.  “The witch has already been defeated by me. Now, no matter what happens, the witch cannot go  "}
{"text": "against my orders!”  Of course, I added.  "}
{"text": "“Tt is no longer possible for her to cause any harm to the people of the continent. Gentlemen. You may  rest assured about the witch!”  "}

{"text": "“No, wait a minute!”  Sarbast Aegim, who was subservient to the authority of the Holy Protection Sword, seemed to be trying  to somehow believe what I said, but the other commanders had a ‘what a load of bullshit’ expression on  "}
{"text": "their faces.  Among them, the Chief Holy Knight took a step forward and shouted.  "}
{"text": "“What the hell are you doing?! We came here to defeat the witch.”  “T mean, the emissary of the Founding Emperor already said, the witch has already been defeated...”  “How can we believe that?!”  "}
{"text": "“On-, on the contrary, how can I not trust him? The emissary of the Founding Emperor ordered me  tOa3: But did you not see the witch do all those things?”  "}
{"text": "Sarbast Aegim was angered. The power of the Holy Protection Sword was indeed amazing.  The Chief Holy Knight had a face that said ‘I’m going to jump up and down crazily.’ He shouted while  jumping.  "}
{"text": "“How can you believe that...... No, no, no, no, in the first place! Isn’t that one sword the only thing that  could prove that the young man was the emissary of the Founding Emperor? You’ve been going at it  since just now just for that one mere sword...... 2  "}
{"text": "“One mere sword you say?”  Sarbast Aegim’s voice rose.  "}
{"text": "“Did you just say that one blade!? Oh my God. Right now, you dare doubt the authority of the  Founding Emperor, who founded the Empire?! The evidence that we are favored by the goddess is that  Holy Protection Sword. How dare you!”  "}
{"text": "The Chief Holy Knight flinched.  “No, General. Calm down... I didn’t mean it to that extent,”  "}
{"text": "“The Founding Emperor took that sword and left for the wilderness! Running through the fields,  leaving a legacy in every city he went, climbed volcanoes, burned down waterfalls, and even pierced  mountains! Just to establish the Empire! All our ancestors stood with the Founding Emperor, and all of  us owe him! But did you just say ‘just for that mere blade’?!”  "}
{"text": "“No, that’s not what I meant......  “Tf not, then what the hell were you talking about?!”  "}
{"text": "“Yo-, Your Holiness, the Pope had given me orders. I was given a strict order to defeat the evil witch at  all costs... But just because of one word,”  The general of the Empire screamed.  "}
{"text": "“What do you mean just because of one word?! You are indirectly questioning the words of the  Founding Emperor’s emissary using the order of the Pope!”  "}
{"text": "Wow.  “What, what...”  "}
{"text": "The Chief Holy Knight shut his mouth.  It took exactly two seconds for his bewilderment to turn into anger.  “Back at you, you dare doubt the authority of the Temple of God!”  “Didn’t you first doubt the authority of the Holy Protection Sword?!”  "}
{"text": "“Oh ohhhh, good! I got it! Seems like the Third Prince that you are loyal to doesn’t need the Pope’s  declaration of support.”  "}
{"text": "“Ha, what declaration of support?! The emissary of the Founding Emperor has already turned up and  defeated the witch. What does the Goddess’s love have to do with looking over the sovereignty of the  Empire?”  "}
{"text": "“So is that really the will of the Third Prince’s faction?”  The Empire’s General and the Knights of the Temple were squabbling fiercely.  "}
{"text": "I was grinning happily inside.  “Very good.’  There was something you must be careful about when groups of people band together.  "}

{"text": "Holding on to Yoo Soo-ha’s shoulder, I looked back at the commanding officers. Yoo Soo-ha tried to  move his limbs, but it was useless. Because it was impossible for him to defy me no matter what he  did, as I was his ‘Master’.  "}

{"text": "“T can’t believe it! You really cleared everything all the way until the 20th floor in five days! Are you  crazy? You’re crazy right?”  “Excuse me. Black Dragon Witch, please calm down a little bit....”  "}
{"text": "“You don’t know how much of an uproar there the tower is in right now! Look at this!”  The Witch showed me something.  It was a smartphone.  "}
{"text": "It was a five-year-old model. On the phone screen that had a low battery indication, there were internet  articles that were not supposed to be accessible here.  "}
{"text": "“This is...?”  “T stopped by the first floor and took a picture!”  "}
{"text": "The witch had a genuinely excited voice.  "}
{"text": "“There were so many articles that it was impossible to record them all! Sorry! But Death King, you  have to understand.

{"text": "The Witch nodded.  As I wasn’t released from the headlock yet, her face was a little close.  “Of course!”  "}

{"text": "“Of course it was because I wanted to do something for you!”  “Oh, just in case, don’t read the article comments later on. It’s all about frame and fraud. The  comments section has just been terrorized by a bunch of jealous humans.”  "}
{"text": "The witch let out a short sigh.  "}
{"text": "“T don’t know why those good-for-nothings always do that. What an amazing thing it was that the death  count was zero! Death King. Don’t pay heed to any of them. From now on, the Black Dragon guild will  take full charge of the media.”  "}

{"text": "Only then did the Witch release me from her headlock.  What the Witch was trying to show me this time was not a phone screen. The Black Dragon Witch  loosened and tilted her small backpack, then took out a thick bundle of newspapers.  "}

{"text": "The Witch laughed.  “T can’t believe you climbed all the way up here in one shot from outside the rankings!”  Third in ranking.  "}
{"text": "Just like a Hunter’s nickname, the ranking was also decided by the tower.  The ranking that was established this way was displayed on a monument erected in the first-floor plaza.  "}

{"text": "“My actions?”  "}
{"text": "“Mmmhmm. Now you’re in all of the top 5 guilds. But in actual fact, you’re no different from a solo  Hunter. Now that things have worked out so well, it’s also good for you to create a new guild for  yourself.”  "}

{"text": "“Oh ho, are you talking about me behind my back now?”  "}
{"text": "“That’s that...”  The witch turned her head, ignoring the Sword Saint.  “What are those?”  "}
{"text": "On the other side of the Acacia field.  On the small plain, the Continent’s soldiers were building something. It was a barracks. They gave up  "}
{"text": "attacking the paradise of the vengeful ghost, and in return, they would take a day off today and  withdraw their troops afterwards.  “Ahhh.”  "}
{"text": "I stroked my chin.  “These soldiers gathered from all over the Continent.”  “From all over the Continent?”  "}
{"text": "“To give you some context....”  I continued explaining. Of course, the story of the vengeful ghost was omitted. I only spoke about how  "}
{"text": "I deceived the Continent’s army.  The Witch and the Sword Saint heard the story together, and as the explanation continued, their  expressions became weird. A word from the Witch represented the two Hunter’s thoughts.  "}
{"text": "“Death King... I see that you have pretty good senses when it comes to lying.”  “Well, thanks to you, the stage was cleared without shedding any blood.”  "}
{"text": "“No, I’m not blaming you. On the contrary, you did really well.”  The Witch’s gaze sharpened.  It was the look of a merchant who came up with an insidious plan.  "}
{"text": "“This means from now on, we can trade here on the continent. We don’t have to grovel anymore to the  old guys in the outside world. Those bad guys! They always lower the prices using their source of food.  We'll see if they can do that in the future.”  "}
{"text": "Resentment was flowing from her voice.  “Basically, the trade between the tower and the outside world was unfair.”  Said the Sword Saint.  "}
{"text": "“Capital, resources, technology. Whatever it was, the outside world has richer resources as compared to  the tower. Of course, some elixirs and materials in the tower can’t be obtained from the outside world  either.”  "}
{"text": "“Food provisions! Food is always a problem!”  The witch stamped on the ground.  "}
{"text": "When I first saw her, I thought she was an unfriendly person. Is it because the three of us broke through  the 12th to 19th floors together? She expressed her feelings colourfully in front of us.  "}
{"text": "That meant we had become that much closer.  “Anyways, Black Dragon Witch, you mean to say you’re going to start trading with the people of the  Continent?”  "}
{"text": "“Hmm? Of course. The outside world needs to know what bitterness tastes like too.”  “Then.”  "}
{"text": "I grinned.  Then I pointed to the military camp that was set up on the plains.  "}
{"text": "“You’re going to have to talk to them from now onwards. If you just say ‘Let’s trade’, it’s not gonna  work. To the people of the Continent, we are strangers, and for us, they are other-worlders.”  “That’s right.”  "}
{"text": "“T’ll lend you my name.”  I said.  “T am the emissary of the Founding Emperor and an apostle of the goddess in this world. If you make it  "}
{"text": "look like you are also an apostle sent by the goddess, at the very least it will be useful for you to start  trading with them.”  The witch’s gaze sharpened again.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s an offer I’d be thankful for. It’s also an effective move. But you are definitely not gonna lend me  your name for free, so... What do you want?”  “The 20th floor.”  "}
{"text": "“What?”  I looked around.  "}
{"text": "Acacia fields. A small plain. The hometown of Estelle.  This little world was all that was on the 20th floor.  “T want the 20th floor.”  "}
{"text": "For a moment the Witch was at a loss for words.  “...Hold on. What do you mean by the 20th floor? Don’t tell me you want to have the whole 20th floor  to yourself?”  "}
{"text": "“Yes. To be exact, I want to possess all the land that is on the 20th floor.”  “That’s...”  "}
{"text": "“Instead, I won’t accept anything for clearing the 11th and 19th floors. You can share the benefits of  trading with the Continent with the other Hunters.”  "}
{"text": "Again, the Witch’s lips were shut tight.  It was an unprecedented offer.  "}
{"text": "Usually, when Hunters raid the stage, the participants would first share their achievements among  themselves. The ownership of an item. And furthermore, the ownership of resources. But about half of  the rights were left to be shared by all other Hunters.  "}
{"text": "It was unprecedented for someone to have the whole [One Floor].  “This is...... not something I can take care of on my own.”  The Witch had a perplexed expression.  "}
{"text": "“We need to call in the other guild masters to discuss about it.”  “Well, I don’t have anything to do for the next 24 hours, so I’ll wait.”  “_.. You really want the whole stage here to yourself?”  "}
{"text": "The Witch glanced around.  “This land, it doesn’t seem very valuable at all. The Acacia flower path...is pretty, but there’s not  enough land to farm. And the size of the stage is also small.”  "}
{"text": "“Well.”  "}
{"text": "“Based on my experience, Death King. In such cases, it is much more profitable to receive the  distributed rewards from the 11th to 20th floors that have been cleared. You’!l be able to earn a  fortune.”  "}
{"text": "I laughed.  “T prefer real estate to money. Land is the best.”  “Call?”  "}
{"text": "[T/N: Call is like a Korean slang for agreeing to something, e.g. going out for drinks or whatnot. ]  The Witch sighed.  "}
{"text": "“T’ll gather the guild masters. Let’s discuss it on the 1st floor.”  “Okay then.”  “Mmmhmm. You have to show your face to the people at least once anyway. But...”  "}
{"text": "The Witch slowly glanced around.  “There is something I wanted to ask you since before.”  “Yes.”  "}
{"text": "“_,.What the hell is that?”  I looked at the direction the Witch pointed at.  "}
{"text": "“Fu-,ck... Black... fucker, this, stop... Make it stop! Is it such a difficult request?! Fuck! What kind of  grudge do you have against me, what did I do wrong...??!!”  "}
{"text": "A top dancer was showing off his skills there.  The dancer’s sweat and tears flowed down the Acacia fields beautifully.  It was beautiful.  "}
{"text": "“Black Dragon Witch.”  I smiled brightly.  "}
{"text": "“Black Dragon Witch, you didn’t see anything today.”  “Huh?”  “You didn’t see anything today. You know what to do right?”  "}
{"text": "The Witch had a curious look on her face.  She had the same face as a biologist who had encountered the mysteries of a lifetime.  “That’s right. There are all kinds of people in the world. I understand.”  "}
{"text": "“But,” the witch murmured.  “As expected, you’re also out of your mind....”  It was also an irrelevant opinion.  "}
{"text": "2  I left the vengeful ghost and the Flame Emperor on the 20th floor, and transferred to the 1st floor with  "}
{"text": "the Hunters.  “Ts it okay for the meeting place to be held at the coffee shop we went to last time?”  "}
{"text": "“Yes. I don’t mind.”  It’s been a long time since I came back to the city on the 1st floor. Babylon.  To others, it may seem like I returned after only five days, but that wasn’t the case for me.  "}
{"text": "Literally hundreds of days. It was the first time in years that I had returned to the city.  “Haaaaihhh.”  “What’s wrong?”  "}
{"text": "“Nothing. I’m coming to realization now, that I’ve cleared the stage.”  The Witch giggled.  “I’m not sure. You probably need to comprehend it a little more.”  "}
{"text": "“Huh?”  “T told you. In the tower right now, you’re the only thing everyone’s talking about. Brace yourself.”  "}
{"text": "There was no need to ask what kind of preparation he had to do.  “Huh?”  "}
{"text": "“Ts that perhaps...?”  Not long after I stepped on the first floor transfer gate, the surrounding area began to buzz noisily.  Passers-by on the street. Street vendors who set up stalls by the side of the road. Hunters, who were just  "}
{"text": "getting ready to leave to go hunting, all whispered one after another.  “Tsn’t that the Witch and the Sword Saint.”  “Then that guy is....”  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s the Death King!”  Someone shouted. That was just the start.  “The Death King appeared!”  "}
{"text": "A customer who was carefully looking at the used weapons at the stall turned his head. A couple who  were enjoying coffee at an outdoor café stood up. Merchants selling rare flowers, Hunters chatting with  their colleagues, dozens, hundreds, all at once, looked this way. My way.  "}
{"text": "A crowd flocked together in an instant.  “Uwaaahh, wow—”  "}
{"text": "“There’s a rumor that you cleared the 20th floor by yourself, is that true?”  “Look here please! Wait please! Here here!”  Chatter chatter.  "}
{"text": "I didn’t even have time to cope with anything. Just, I blinked my eyes once and people already  surrounded our party. That wasn’t the end. When I blinked twice, the encirclement doubled in size.  "}
{"text": "“Uh...”  “Don’t say anything.”  "}
{"text": "The Witch whispered softly with a voice that only I could hear.  “You haven’t had any experiences dealing with the press, have you?”  “Yes, well. Of course.”  "}
{"text": "“Mysticism? Popular star?”  “What?”  "}
{"text": "“T’m talking about the concept. Do you want a mysterious concept or a popular star concept?”  The crowd tripled while the Witch was whispering. Our party’s pace seemed to have slowed down by  30 times. Snap! Snap! Every step of the way, cell phone cameras continuously flashed.  "}
{"text": "Oh my God.  "}
{"text": "It felt like I was out of my mind!  “Once a concept is set, it’s hard to change it. You need to give me an answer now.”  “Uh. I know what the mysterious concept means, but what’s a popular star concept?”  “Tt’s similar to a movie star.”  "}
{"text": "Said the Witch.  “First of all, you need to make a new SNS account. You need to have a secretary for image  "}
{"text": "management and a secretary that deals with the media. Of course, you should also hire someone who  takes care of your looks and fashion. Oh, don’t worry about the money. The Black Dragon guild will  take care of that.”  "}
{"text": "I lost my mind even more.  Next to us, the Sword Saint was frowning.  He muttered a few words.  "}
{"text": "“T hate dealing with this bullshit, so ll go on my own.”  It sounded reasonable.  “T’d like to have a mysterious concept....”  "}
{"text": "“Are you sure? A person changes when they receives some maintenance. It’s natural to be much more  handsome than now, and you’ll realize some new ways of dealing with other humans.”  "}
{"text": "For example in the case of the Heretic Questioner, he’s a magazine model and he probably also does  personal photo shoots?”  "}
{"text": "I too knew that well.  Before returning back to 4000 days, didn’t I used to collect those magazines and pictorials? Even the  Black Dragon Witch right in front of me was a regular model for magazine covers.  "}
{"text": "“No, mysticism! I want to have a mysterious concept.”  However, if I was the one involved, it’d be a different story.  “Why? You don’t want to shoot a pictorial?”  "}
{"text": "Was I shot in the head to be like that?!  “T’ll die of embarrassment.”  "}
{"text": "“They’re all shy at first. No wait, the Heretic Questioner didn’t know what shame was even when he  first started... He’s an exception. Death King, if we’re talking about embarrassing things, when you  went up the Pavilion at the Aegim Empire and shouted, that was even more...”  "}
{"text": "“T’m leaving the top five guilds if it’s not mysticism.”  I meant it whole-heartedly.  "}
{"text": "The Witch lightly laughed.  “Yes. I suppose you’ll do that. You look like you’d really do it.”  "}
{"text": "“What should I do about the mysterious concept?”  “Simple. You just need to have a good poker face.”  "}
{"text": "This was the first time in my life ever that I heard somebody advising me ,saying ‘Keep a good poker  face’.  “SNS activities are absolutely forbidden. No magazines or broadcast. Even if a personal broadcast  "}
{"text": "streamer or media company asks for an interview, refuse it. It’s okay to have an interview about twice a  year. I’ll only send you reporters that I have verified in advance.”  Hmmm.  "}
{"text": "“.,.That’s all>?”  “You still don’t know how difficult that will be.”  "}
{"text": "The Witch giggled.  “Attention is a drug. The most addictive sort of drug.”  The Sword Saint stepped in after she said that.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s also a drug that thoroughly destroys people the most.”  “That’s right. If just 10 people paid attention to someone, that person would feel happy. But when you  "}
{"text": "reach this spot, even if you say a few words, dozens and hundreds of people will react to it. There  aren’t really a lot of people who can resist this sort of drug.”  An even bigger crowd gathered.  "}
{"text": "It was as if the population of the whole city gathered here.  “Tt’s all for naught.”  That’s what the Sword Saint said.  "}
{"text": "“Yeah. But it sure is a pleasant piece of crap.”  The Witch replied.  "}
{"text": "“Maybe knowing how to enjoy this kind of drug is also a famous person’s accomplishment. Until they  get tired of the drug. Or you could choose to hang in there until you’re disillusioned with your  companions who take the same drug. What do you want to do, Death King?”  "}
{"text": "I looked around me.  A curtain of people.  "}
{"text": "It was packed with people, leaving no gaps. The camera flashes went off constantly, so I had to squint.  The continuous flashes were eye-blinding, and felt like a mirage, and the curtain of people looked  almost like a shadow.  "}
{"text": "“...No one would be as hung up on others as I was.”  I opened my mouth.  "}
{"text": "“What I want to get is recognition. And although I don’t really know... I think receiving attention and  recognition is a little different.”  "}
{"text": "I thought of the Flame Emperor.  Before returning 4000 times, he was the supreme being that hogged the limelight of the tower.  “T don’t need the attention of millions of people. Just the attention of people around me is enough.  "}
{"text": "Hundreds of thousands or millions, what I want from the people of the world is... It’s not attention, it’s  recognition.”  “Alright then.”  "}
{"text": "The Witch smiled.  “T think they’re not that different. But if that’s your answer, I’ ll respect it.”  “Yes.”  "}
{"text": "“I’m glad you’re such a person.”  I had heard something like that before too.  "}
{"text": "“So how do you make a good poker face?”  “T’Il teach you the secret.”  The sound of the crowd burst from every direction.  "}
{"text": "Shortly, the speed of our party dropped to about 10 centimeters per second.  “This really reminds me of a bad memory.”  “A bad memory?”  "}
{"text": "“Yes. In my case, when I was in the outside world, my father died in a civil war.”  The Witch said calmly.  "}
{"text": "“Tt was when I was seven. I was running away with my parents, and the soldiers probably came after  us. My father stayed behind. Then, my father shouted, ‘Don’t look back and run quickly’. But...”  The witch led the way through the crowd.  "}
{"text": "“T really ran without looking back. I heard a gunshot, but I didn’t turn around. I kept running.”  Snap! Snap!  "}
{"text": "The camera’s flashes didn’t stop.  “Tt happened when you were young right.”  “Tt happened when I was young.”  "}
{"text": "The witch murmured.  “Tt’s not that I hated the fact that I ran away. I was a kid. But, why didn’t I look back? It would have  "}
{"text": "been an easy thing to do. It was just looking.”  its ”  "}
{"text": "“T think of those times when I have to put on a poker face. When I recall the memory of my heart  beating fast, I can put up a really good poker face. It’s like a little magic trick of my own.”  "}
{"text": "The Witch looked at me.  “You have one or two such memories, don’t you?”  I did.  "}
{"text": "A dark alley.  I recalled the memory of when the Flame Emperor gripped my head and burned my whole body.  “T suppose so.”  "}
{"text": "I could tell even without looking in the mirror.  That I was putting up a perfect poker face.  "}
{"text": "“Please look here for a while!”  “Please say something, anything!”  “Black Dragon Witch, when can I hear the official announcement...”  "}
{"text": "“What kind of relationship do the two of you have?!”  “Sword Saint-nim! What do you think of Death King?!”  "}
{"text": "When I looked around again, before I knew it, I got used to the camera flashes, so I could see my  surroundings better. I had never been surrounded by such a large crowd before. It was also the first time  that I faced a shower of flashes like this.  "}
{"text": "But.  “Tt’s immediately effective though?”  I wasn’t as out of mind as before.  "}

{"text": "While I was working hard to hack up the Devil King’s minions, the guild master’s party seemed to  have been pretty active as well.  "}
{"text": "“Uhuh. I know all too well that we all had a wonderful life out there in the outside world.”  The witch shrugged and sat down at the table.  "}
{"text": "“The Count was born in a slum village in India. Venomous Snake, your parents were gang leaders.  Crusader had suffered some hardships in Venezuela.”  “So we were all garbage when we were in the outside world. Don’t you all agree?”  "}

{"text": "“Yes.”  Said the Witch.  "}
{"text": "“You guys probably don’t know, but Death King had made a decisive contribution to clearing the  tower.”  "}
{"text": "“That’s something we also know.”  “No. You all don’t know.”  The Witch shook her head.  "}
{"text": "“In the raid this time, we didn’t have a single casualty. Even on the 11th floor, where a lot of Hunters  participated together. This was all thanks to Death King who taught me the strategies and tactics to  clearing the floors.”  "}

{"text": "“p>  The Witch opened her mouth.  "}
{"text": "“This man, I want to make him the hero who represents our tower.”  Silence hung over the cafe.  The Witch looked at the Hunters that were sitting around the table one by one.  "}
{"text": "“Count. You disclosed too much of your wealth.”  “Tt’s true, I can’t say otherwise.”  “Heretic Questioner. You’ve killed too many people.”  "}
{"text": "“Yes! It was a necessary sacrifice!”  “Crusader. You don’t like receiving attention from other people at all.”  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s just how my character is.”  “And Venomous Snake. You...”  “Huh? What?”  "}
{"text": "“...[’m sorry. You’re too ugly.”  Venomous Snake pouted. A dejected expression. But he soon bowed his head.  It was a portrait of a sorrowful middle-aged man.  "}
{"text": "“Sword Saint, as we all know, is an old man that is only crazy for the sword.”  "}
{"text": "“Mmhmmm.”  “And me, I have to constantly act behind the scenes so it can’t be me.”  After looking at those sitting at the table one by one, the Witch finally looked back at me.  "}
{"text": "“On the other hand, Death King doesn’t have any impression on the public yet. If we try hard enough,  we can make it so that he becomes a perfect hero however much we want. This is an opportunity. An  opportunity to revamp the tower’s previous image.”  "}
{"text": "“Would that really be the case?”  Heretic Questioner stroked his chin.  “We’re all people that have been around for a long time, so it’s true our presence has grown a little  "}
{"text": "weaker! We’ve continued to print out magazines that contain updates on the activities of Hunters, but in  the outside world, the sales volume is steadily decreasing!”  “Yes. That’s what I mean.”  "}
{"text": "“Then we’ll have to start ‘making’ our image from today onwards!”  Heretic Questioner stood up.  And just like a puppy, he began to circle around me.  "}
{"text": "“Hmm. You’re a little short. But that’s fine! As you can see from my example, the photos will be able  to cover all that!”  "}
{"text": "“Uae”  No. Wasn’t he just emphasizing that his height was his charming point?  "}
{"text": "There was a big smile on the short Hunter’s small face.  “[A short but passionate man, Death King]. If you use a catchphrase like this, it’1l work!”  Without having the chance to say anything, the Hunters gathered around me.  "}
{"text": "Witch. Count. Venomous Snake. Crusader.  Regardless of which guild they were from, all of them came close to me, and carefully examined my  whole body.  "}
{"text": "“T’m asking just in case, but are you seeing anyone now?”  “Uh... No, I’m not.”  "}
{"text": "“What about since you entered the tower? Any ex-lovers?”  “Nope.”  "}
{"text": "“That means, there’s no need to worry about a scandal. This is the best!”  I didn’t know what was best about it.  "}
{"text": "The top-ranking Hunters began to chatter among themselves.  “T’ve been watching him from the side, but this man, when he smiles, he gives off a cunning  "}

{"text": "Said the Crusader.  “We need to create a scandal that doesn’t exist here. Otherwise, the people out there are just going to  spread false rumors....”  "}
{"text": "“No worries. I’ll take care of it.”  "}
{"text": "“Ohhh! Will it be a scenario where love blossomed as you stood side by side fighting together for five  days? Hahaha, I like it! I can make a story that people would definitely dig!”  “What about a scenario where he donated the majority of the money he earned so far to an orphanage?  "}
{"text": "In case something like this might happen, I made regular donations anonymously(#é #). Let’s just say  the donations were actually from Death King.”  "}

{"text": ""}
{"text": "“Mmhmm. I’ll leave it to you, Count.”  What’s this?  "}
{"text": "What’s going on here?  “For starters, let’s call a photographer! Let’s take some pictures!”  Heretic Questioner smiled brightly.  "}
{"text": "“Call all the designers, too. We’re going to have to at least give a picture to the press by the end of the  day anyway. We’ve already taken a video of the battle on the 11th floor, so we’ll upload it on the  internet when the right time comes!”  "}
{"text": "No.  Wait.  "}
{"text": "“Hey, guys....”  “Don’t worry.”  The Witch stopped me and smiled.  "}
{"text": "It was a smile that told me about her numerous profound experiences.  “Death King. You won’t have to do anything. We’|l take care of everything. You... that’s right. You just  "}
{"text": "have to do what you’ve always done till now.”  “No, you said it was a mysticism concept. I thought we didn’t need someone like a designer?”  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s just today, please.”  The Witch gently put her hands together.  "}
{"text": "“Everyone in the world wants to know about you. One picture. Let’s just take one picture and show it  to the people. Huh? Don’t worry, Death King. The designers who signed an exclusive contract with us  are amazing.”  "}
{"text": "I came to a realization 30 minutes later, that it was never going to be just one picture.  “Look here!”  Snap!  "}
{"text": "Up to ten designers came and dressed me up. They styled my hair. Whenever I was dressed and my hair  was styled, the photographer’s camera flashes started to go off.  "}
{"text": "“Yes, that’s good. This time, hold the dagger! Like a wolf in a thicket waiting to hunt its prey!”  “No... Wait...”  “Very good!”  "}
{"text": "Snap!  The Hunters huddled behind the photographer. They whispered as they examined my pose with hawk-  "}
{"text": "like gazes.  “Dressing up in a suit unexpectedly fits him well.”  "}
{"text": "“Maybe we should go with a somewhat playful vibe.”  “No can do! Because the playful concept is mine first!”  “That’s true. Then what should we... Then how about a flaming youth with an adventurous spirit?”  "}
{"text": "“Let’s go with that.”  Snap!  “Very good!”  "}
{"text": "Very good, my ass.  -Poohahahahahahha! Pooha, poohahaa! Keuhahahahahahhahah!!  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong was rolling about in the air since a while ago.  1 hour passed, and then 2 hours went by, but the photo shoot didn’t seem like it would end anytime  soon, so my patience reached a limit.  "}
{"text": "“I’m not doing it! Let’s stop all this!”  I stripped off the suit I was wearing and threw it on the floor.  "}
{"text": "“Hunters just have to climb the tower diligently! What media image?! What photoshoot?! Because all  these useless things are always on your mind, for several years, the lot of you couldn’t even clear the  10th floor!”  "}
{"text": "Silence.  Did my heartfelt words work? The air became awkward. All the Hunters, including the Witch, stared at  "}
{"text": "my face.  And nodded.  "}
{"text": "“_,.Wasn’t that a pretty good speech?”  “Mmhmm. It felt like you really are a flaming youth with an adventurous spirit!”  “The headline of this time’s magazine will be [The Hunter Who Climbed the Tower].”  “We also had that passion in our twenties....”  "}
{"text": "It didn’t work at all.  “Ahhh, no thanks! I came here to talk about the 20th floor. I’ll give you all the rights from the 10th to  "}
{"text": "the 19th floor, so make sure the 20th floor is mine!”  The Hunters nodded again.  “T like your greedless concept, too.”  "}
{"text": "“How about this for tomorrow’s newspaper headline? [Death King, Shocking Announcement. Declares  to distribute the rights of the 10th to 19th floors to all the other Hunters. Declares that he’s satisfied  with being able to clear the tower. ]  "}
{"text": "“Agreed!”  "}
{"text": "“Tt will be appropriate to write an article on the second page like this, [Death King, known to have  regularly donated to an orphanage].”  “Yeah. Let’s just say that we’re giving him the 20th floor as a sign of gratitude and respect to Death  "}
{"text": "King.”  “Perfect! Ahhh, what a beautiful finish!”  "}
{"text": "Wrong.  They didn’t listen to a single thing I said.  These people were too preoccupied right now by the idea of making me a hero.  "}
{"text": "“Just give up, young man.”  The Sword Saint spoke bluntly.  The old swordsman stood with his back against the pillar of the building.  "}
{"text": "“The same thing happened when I was ranked number 1. Something like being old would make a  favourable impression on the world, and asking me to grow my beard differently. I heard all sorts of  things then.”  "}
{"text": "Oh my God.  "}
{"text": "“This was what they wanted to show the outside world. [We’re living an honorable life too] It’s kind of  an inferiority complex.”  The old man murmured.  "}
{"text": "“They abandoned everything in the outside world and came to the tower anyway. What’s so pathetic  about it...”  "}
{"text": "The Sword Saint stepped away.  “Let’s go.”  “Yes?”  "}
{"text": "“If you stay here, it’ll be endless. After you finish the photo shoot, they’ I tell you to take a video and  then after that, they’ II tell you to prepare for a press conference. They’re that kind of people. If you  don’t run away now, the whole day will go by just like that.”  "}
{"text": "It sounded horrible.  Without the need to even think about it, I said.  “Let’s run away quickly!”  "}
{"text": "“Good decision.”  Focusing aura on the tip of our toes, we ran. A cry could be heard from behind us, “Ahhh!” but we  "}
{"text": "didn’t stop.  “Death King!”  Cried the Witch.  "}
{"text": "“I’m holding a press conference tomorrow, so come back in the morning if you can! You shouldn’t be  seen by others, so go around secretly! Even if you want to run away, get on the roof and run! Be  careful!”  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong laughed hysterically.  -Hey. That person isn’t an angel, nor is she a Goddess. Isn’t she more like a mom?  "}
{"text": "That really was the case.  And I didn’t even know what kind of existence a Mother was.  4.  "}
{"text": "Before I knew it, the sun had set.  Following what the Witch advised us, we went towards the roof and ran. Looking down from above,  "}
{"text": "there were still hundreds of people crowding in front of the cafe. A swarm of reporters from the  broadcasting station was there too.  ‘We could’ve been in trouble if we went out from the front door!’  "}
{"text": "We skipped through the crimson-colored roof.  The place we stopped at, was the bell tower built in the square.  "}
{"text": "The guard who was guarding the bell tower and fiddling with a smartphone recognized us belatedly.  “Hukkk! Swo-, Sword Saint-nim!”  “Mmmhmm.”  "}
{"text": "The Sword Saint landed at the bell tower easily.  “T’m sorry, but can you excuse us for a moment?”  "}
{"text": "“Ahhh. It’s... That’s....”  “Five minutes is enough.”  "}
{"text": "The young guard was flustered. He must’ve been taken aback when a living legend asked him to  excuse himself. Then our eyes met, and the guard’s eyes opened wide.  “Are you perhaps the Death King! >?”  "}
{"text": "“Ah. Yes.”  “Uwaaa. Wowv! It’s my first time seeing you in person, woww! Awesome!”  The guard scurried through his bag. A romance novel popped out from the bag. He seemed to have  "}
{"text": "brought some random things to kill time when he was on guard duty.  “Thi-, this is the only paper I have right now! May I have your autograph, please?”  Sword Saint took the novel as if he was familiar with this situation.  "}
{"text": "“Do you have a pen?”  “He-here it is!”  “What’s your name?”  "}
{"text": "“Well, I haven’t received a nickname yet, so...!”  The old swordsman signed in neat strokes.  "}
{"text": "The guard took the sign like an innocent boy and looked back at me.  I don’t know why, but his eyes were very bright.  “Dea-, Death King-nim, may I also ask for your signature too!”  “Uh.”  "}
{"text": "My autograph?  “T’ve never signed anything before though....”  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s my lifelong wish! Please!”  Dazed, I was given a pen and a novel.  "}
{"text": "How is his lifelong wish to receive my autograph? How light was his life?  Feeling a little awkward, I put down the novel. Sword Saint’s autograph was already written there.  While I was trying to write my autograph with a pen, I suddenly realized that it was the first time I had  "}
{"text": "written the name “Death King”.  Before I realized, Sword Saint’s and my handwriting was already side by side.  "}
{"text": "+  Sword Saint # i.  "}
{"text": "Death King #t =.  "}
{"text": "“Tha-, thank you! Thank you so much!”  "}
{"text": "The guard bowed his back. Afraid that the autograph might disappear, the guard quickly took the novel  back.  "}
{"text": "When the guard took the novel, I was filled with a strange feeling, and it was hard for me to even  determine what it felt like.  "}
{"text": "“Excuse me...”  “T’ll honor it as a family heirloom! Don’t worry! I’ll never sell it to anyone else! Oh, thank you both so  much! Have a happy weekend!”  "}
{"text": "The guard quickly went down the steps of the bell tower. Thrilled, he said “Yayyy! What a lucky day!”,  and his excited voice gradually faded downwards.  "}
{"text": "When the voice was finally gone, A speck-like crimson red sun that was setting could be seen from the  bell tower.  "}
{"text": "And only the silent breathing of the two remained.  Both of us were silent for a while.  And then...  "}
{"text": "“Errmmm, Sword Saint-nim.”  “Hey, young man.”  "}
{"text": "Sword Saint’s and my words clashed and faded away. It became like that because both of us spoke at  the same time.  An awkward silence, but it didn’t last long.  "}
{"text": "I said.  "}
{"text": "“Sword Saint-nim, to you, it must look as if I have killed a tremendous amount of people. A mass  murderer that must be punished.”  I looked at the Sword Saint with a calm face.  "}
{"text": "“But if you look in the mirror, you will also see a mass murderer who has killed a great number of  people. That person is you, Sword Saint-nim.”  "}
{"text": "Sword Saint was looking at the sunset, not me.  “But Sword Saint-nim, you wouldn’t punish yourself for that. This is because you have a clear standard  "}
{"text": "for killing someone. And the standard is [punish those who hurt many people].”  While the twilight spread, I continued on saying.  "}
{"text": "“T also had clear standards, and that was why I did what I did. And the standard is [punish those who  hurt many people].”  "}
{"text": "This was what I had prepared in advance since the time I lied to the Sword Saint that I was a prophet.  “If Sword Saint-nim killed someone because they killed many people before, I killed someone before  they could kill many other people.”  "}
{"text": "It was a meticulous lie that I specially prepared for the Sword Saint.  “So, Sword Saint-nim. You and J are actually walking on the same path......  “Young man.”  "}
{"text": "But before I could finish my lie, the old man gently called out to me.  “You don’t have to try to justify yourself like that.”  Yes.  "}
{"text": "“Sword Saint-nim, I....”  “Young man.”  "}
{"text": "I shut my mouth as he called out to me in his low-pitched voice.  While staring at the sunset, the old man muttered.  “T’m different from the other Hunters.”  "}
{"text": "At first glance, the remark seemed to come out of the blue.  “Black Dragon Witch. Count. Heresy Questioner. Venomous Snake. Crusader... they’re all kids who  suffered harshly in the outside world. But I’m different. I was born without shortages, and lived without  "}
{"text": "any shortages.”  Marcus Calenberry.  "}
{"text": "I knew the old man in front of me was from a prestigious household. Rather than knowing, I did a full-  scale investigation on him as a foe, and looked him up. They say he came from a prestigious family  recognized throughout Northern Europe.  "}
{"text": "“When the tower appeared in the world, I had already built my own family. I ran a company, I had been  married, I had children, I had seen my children have grandsons and granddaughters. I’ve seen enough  success already.”  "}
{"text": "The Sword Saint’s voice was calm.  “But I questioned.”  "}
{"text": "“What do you mean by questioned?”  “Is my success all due to my capabilities? I suddenly felt curious.”  The old man slowly pulled his sword out of its sheath.  "}
{"text": "“Wasn’t it purely because I was born into a good household?”  The sunset shone.  The sword was crimson-red even though it had not cut anything.  "}
{"text": "“Wasn’t it just because I was a ‘bird’ born into a good family, received a good education, met good  friends, and grew up only by drinking the best things? I was proud of the fact that I achieved everything  myself...But maybe it was just a delusion of someone trapped in a birdcage.”  "}
{"text": "The Sword Saint explained.  “No, that’s not it.”  "}
{"text": "It was a blade-like sharp voice.  “That can’t be.”  "}
{"text": "A scarlet heart, like the sunset, was possessed by him.  “I’m sure I was born with something good. However, I wanted to stand tall and proud on my own. I  wanted to prove that my pride was not a delusion.”  "}
{"text": "“_..S0 that’s why you came to the tower.”  “Yes.”  "}
{"text": "The old man nodded.  His wrinkles were deep and thick.  "}
{"text": "“He who enters the tower can never go back to the outside world. Only my body. In this place where  there are no prestigious households, no families, and no aides who support me... I wanted to prove my  way of life with my own body.”  "}
{"text": "However, the Sword Saint murmured.  “T seem to have let my guard down unknowingly.”  “Open Skill Card. Disclose.”  "}
{"text": "Shinngggeg!  A silver card floated from the hand of the Sword Saint.  +  "}
{"text": "[Detective’s Insight]  Rank: B-  "}

{"text": "The Sword Saint lowered his skill card.  “T was going to only trust my eyes and hands, but... Before I knew it, I was relying on [Skills]. I saw it  through the skill rather than through my own eyes, and I had blind faith in the judgment of the skill  "}
{"text": "rather than in my own judgment.”  Then,  "}
{"text": "“Young man. I’ll ask you one last time.”  The old man’s blue eyes turned to look at me.  “Have you ever killed a single innocent life>”  "}
{"text": "Is that all?  So that’s why he said I didn’t have to try to justify myself. I was convinced.  Yes. To justify is to do it with one’s own ‘head’ as I just did.  "}
{"text": "No matter how elaborate a lie maybe, it’s just to fool someone’s mind, and not for winning over their  hearts.  "}
{"text": "“No.”  Persuasion, and not convincing.  "}
{"text": "“T’ve never done that, Sword Saint-nim.”  Just like what I did as the pillar of the tower,  I said whole-heartedly.  "}
{"text": "“T won’t do that in the future either.”  The Sword Saint shut his eyes gently.  "}
{"text": "As if he was reflecting on my expression and voice.  A long silence passed.  And.  "}
{"text": "“Huppp!”  The card flew away.  "}
{"text": "The card that flew into the air, was cut with the crimson-red blade.  A card split in two.  A golden ray of light from the sunset pierced through the cut gap.  “T believe in my eyes.”  "}
{"text": "Soon, the cards became sprinkles of light and dispersed.  The skill was destroyed.  "}
{"text": "“You’ve had a hard time for the last five days. Thank you for going along with the stubbornness of an  old man.”  "}
{"text": "The Sword Saint sheathed his sword.  “Tt’s a bit late to tell you now but, it was quite a pleasant experience seeing you break through the 12th  to 19th floors. Take a good rest today. When the press conference ends tomorrow, the 21st floor will be  "}
{"text": "opened immediately after.”  The old man stomped on the floor.  "}
{"text": "Just before skipping to the roof of another building, he glanced at me.  “T’ll look forward to seeing you perform on the next floor. Death King.”  And in an instant, he was quite a distance away from the bell tower.  For a long time, I stood absent-mindedly.  "}
{"text": "I opened my mouth reluctantly.  “Sword Emperor. What just....”  -Uhhhh.  "}
{"text": "“Just now, Sword Saint-nim acknowledged me, didn’t he?”  -I think so.  "}
{"text": "My heart was at ease.  “Waaaaah....”  "}
{"text": "My knees went weak and I slowly sat down. The floor made of stone was chilly. I stared blankly at the  red sky that was slowly fading and began to turn dark.  "}
{"text": "“Wow, it’s really... It’s really over. The 20th floor is also mine now. And the guild masters will take  care of the press... Yes. It’s really all over.”  Bae Hu-ryeong giggled.  "}
{"text": "-What do you mean over? Someone else might think you just cleared the 50th floor or something.  “Just from what I feel right now, it’s like I just cleared the 90th floor.”  -Tch tch tch. Zombie, sometimes I get confused about whether you have nerves of steel or are you just  "}
{"text": "another coward.  “Actually, I sometimes get confused too....”  "}
{"text": "Anyway, I wrapped up all that I’ve done till the 20th floor.  When I thought of what I had done, I was engulfed by a strange sense of satiety.  [The Goddess of Protection was impressed by your achievements! ]  "}
{"text": "A voice that hadn’t been heard for a while rang.  “Huh?”  Come to think of it.  "}
{"text": "Despite defeating the Devil King of Fall Rain, the Goddess of Protection remained silent. No, except  for the time when I broke through the 12th floor for the first time, the Goddess of Protection was  actually always silent.  "}

{"text": "There was nothing but the stone floor.  [The Goddess of Protection asks you to look to the left a little bit more.]  "}
{"text": "I shifted my gaze to the left.  At that side, my legs and waist were there.  "}

{"text": "I recalled the scene where I was fighting against the Devil King’s army on the 12th floor.  At that time, I was sure that there was a voice stating that the Goddess of Protection was squeezing out  "}

{"text": "-Yes. To properly convey the vibe of the scene, I’ll raise my voice for a bit.  There was a video that seemed to be taken by someone on their cell phone.  In the middle of the screen, I was expressionlessly walking.  "}
{"text": "-Please look this way for a while!  -Please don’t push me away! Please say something!  -Black Dragon Witch, when can we hear the official announcements?!  "}
{"text": "-What kind of relationship are you two....  Tikkk!  "}
{"text": "I couldn’t stand watching it anymore and pressed the remote control.  I frowned at Bae Hu-ryeong who was watching the TV with me side by side.  "}
{"text": "-Ahhh, why did you turn it off? I was enjoying it for quite a while.  I opened my mouth.  “Because I’m so embarrassed that I could just die!”  "}
{"text": "This place is the waiting room.  A day has passed since I received the recognition of Sword Saint.  "}
{"text": "Today was the day where the press conference regarding the progress of clearing the tower will be held.  Originally, it was supposed to be taken care of by the top guild masters, but this time, I was invited as a  special guest. After a while, the interview will start.  "}
{"text": "-Why don’t you just kill yourself? You’re not going to die anyway.  “But I don’t want to!”  "}
{"text": "I didn’t have anything to do until the conference was held, so I thought I’d watch TV, but it was a  mistake.  "}
{"text": "-Ahhh. Fuc-. I got it. Then switch to another channel.  “All channels talk about me anyway!”  Whether it was the news channel or the others, almost all the broadcasts were talking about the raid  "}
{"text": "from the 10th to 20th floors. And TV shows weren’t the only ones. Things were the same even when I  looked on the Internet.  I had become a celebrity after a night’s sleep.  "}
{"text": "That’s what I feel like right now.  [The Goddess of Protection points out that it was just how exceptional your achievement was. |  The Holy Sword quivered on my waist.  "}
{"text": "[Fame is like the taxes a hero has to pay, day by day. The Goddess of Protection advises that you must  get used to the position of Hero. ]  "}
{"text": "I felt so burdened that I lowered the Holy Sword.  “T was so tired yesterday that I fell asleep and couldn’t talk much...Ms. Goddess, you there? Aren’t you  "}
{"text": "thinking too highly of me?”  [You are the light!]  "}
{"text": "The Holy Sword quivered more.  I don’t know if it was just me, but it felt like she was an idol’s obsessed fan.  "}
{"text": "[The Goddess of Protection whispered that she still remembers as clear as day. When you climbed up  the Empire’s castle and gave that roaring speech. And the imposing stance when you declared ‘Leave  the Empire to us from now on’, you were so dashing then. ]  "}
{"text": "“Ahhhhh!”  I covered my ears.  "}
{"text": "“Stop! Stop it! That was what I uttered when I was completely excited!”  But it was to no avail. The Sword’s voice was not heard by my ear but transmitted directly to my head.  The Holy Sword whispered endlessly about my dark history.  "}
{"text": "[Goddess of Protection expressed. It’s an unwritten law that a hero must love himself! The words of a  hero without self-love are always miserable, and it would make even the people around him unhappy.  In that sense, your confidence is very likable! It’s really quite amazing! ]  "}
{"text": "I was right.  The Goddess of Protection was just my huge fan.  "}
{"text": "“Stop... please just stop......!  Just like me who was once an obsessed fan of Flame Emperor, the Holy Sword had been a fan of mine.  I wouldn’t mind if she expressed the burning desire of a fan somewhere I couldn’t see. But the Sword’s  "}

{"text": "Oh my God.  Have I ever heard someone sincerely praising me continuously and been in their company for this  long? Someone, that praised me so incessantly, that it made me think about my dark past which I  "}
{"text": "wanted to forget as soon as possible.  Just kill me instead.  "}
{"text": "[Especially when you brought the Devil King of Fall Rain under your reign, and the moment when you  muttered, “The Lord has the responsibility to protect his own people’, that was truly a great scene... ]  "}
{"text": "This was really too much.  "}
{"text": "I took out the Odo Oil(## iH) from my backpack. Odo Oil was an oil used to clean a blade. I poured  some of the oil on a cloth and glared at the Holy Sword.  "}
{"text": ""}
{"text": "“You started it first. This thing.”  "}
{"text": "My hand reached closer to the blade of the sword.  "}
{"text": "A flicker of white light burst out from the Holy Sword.  [The Goddess of Protection feels threatened. ]  [The Goddess of Protection begs you to stop what you’re doing. ]  "}
{"text": "[The Goddess of Protection... ]  10 minutes later.  [The Goddess of Protection apologizes to you for her blunder.]  "}
{"text": "Sparkle-.  Thanks to my sincere towel skills, the Holy Sword became clean. The blade became as transparent as a  mirror and reflected my face. But the Holy Sword trembled with shame.  "}
{"text": "“Phew, it’s finally a little quiet now.”  I lowered the Holy Sword which had become morte silent.  "}
{"text": "“So I get that you’re a Constellation but why a sword? Did you possess the sword from the very  beginning?”  "}
{"text": "As far as my understanding goes, the Constellation(: 4) was like the administrator of the stage.  "}
{"text": "Like the vengeful ghost, the Constellation may have been a monster at first. I couldn’t even imagine  how the ‘Sword’ became a Constellation.  "}
{"text": "As I muttered that question, the Holy Sword gave off a subtle white glow.  [The Goddess of Protection shakes her head. ]  [It’s easier to just understand that the Constellation is ‘Something that Represents’ the world. ]  "}
{"text": "A representative of the world.  [The Goddess of Protection muttered. |  "}
{"text": "[I was originally a Holy Spirit who was revered as a god. But the Empire’s founder ‘Lefanta Aegim’,  split me into five swords and sealed me. ]  [You are the first possessor of the Holy Swords, ‘Idol’.]  "}
{"text": "I bat my eyes.  “Ts the name of the sword Idol?”  "}
{"text": "[Positive. ]  And then the Goddess of Protection named the five swords.  [First Sword, Idol ({(%).]  "}
{"text": "[Second Sword, Pity (1%2%).]  [Third Sword, Prayer (#7 8).]  "}

{"text": ""}
{"text": "[Fourth Sword, Sacrifice (tk #).]  [Fifth Sword, Salvation (4%). ]  "}
{"text": "[These are the swords of the five sisters. ]  [The goddess of Protection bragged that if you gather all the sister swords, she will regain the strength  from her prime. ]  "}
{"text": "“Ohhh hohhh.”  In short, the sword that was shining in front of my eyes was really just a fragment of the Holy Sword.  "}
{"text": "In other words, the other four swords must be found to draw out its real power.  “Interesting. So where are the sister swords?”  She did not answer.  "}
{"text": "An awkward silence filled the waiting room.  “Hello? Goddess? I’m asking you where your sisters are?”  "}
{"text": "Silence.  [T/N: Original text is =5& (#KK*A4), which means when someone is not answering even after  asking about it numerous times. ]  "}
{"text": "My eyes sharpened.  "}
{"text": "“_.. By any chance, even you don’t know?”  After a while, a voice murmured.  [The Goddess of Protection pleads the Fifth. ]  "}
{"text": "“Tn the end, that just means you don’t know.”  [The Goddess of Protection argues that she can feel the presence of the sister swords if they are close  by. ]  "}
{"text": "I shrugged.  “Well, I’m not in a hurry to find them right now. Anyway, you must have at least a fifth of the power.  Mr. Idol Sword. What can you do?”  "}
{"text": "[I can get absolute support from the citizens of the Aegim Empire. ]  “T know that better than anyone. Anything else?”  "}
{"text": "Shingggg!  As if the Holy Sword was waiting for it, it emitted light at its maximum output.  “Aackk! My eyes?! My eyesss?!”  "}
{"text": "I rolled around the floor while covering my eyes.  "}
{"text": "I could hear the Holy Sword snarling in my head.  [The Goddess of Protection boasts that she is confident in emitting light. ]  “T’ve seen it to the point where I’m sick of it, so of course I know it!”  "}
{"text": "What in the world??? I was lucky that I protected my eyes with Aura in an instant. I almost lost my  eyesight!  “No, what else can you do besides getting the support of the Aegim Empire’s citizens and shining!”  "}
{"text": "Silence fell.  The Holy Sword’s glow dimmed. In human terms, it was as if she was stuttering.  [I’m confident in manipulating monsters. ]  "}
{"text": "[Hurriedly, The Goddess of Protection adds that she is also confident in manipulating humans. ]  Knock knock knock.  "}
{"text": "Amid the silence, where I was dumbfounded, someone knocked on the waiting room door. I quickly  sheathed the Holy Sword. From someone else’s point of view, I would look like a madman if I was  seen talking to the sword.  "}
{"text": "“You are?”  “It’s me.”  The Witch’s voice could be heard from outside the door.  "}
{"text": "“You’ve been noisy since a while ago. Is something wrong?”  “T’m alright. Nothing’s going on!”  “Ts that so...?”  "}
{"text": "The Witch seemed suspicious but did not question me further.  “The press conference will start in five minutes. The reporters will probably shoot you loads of  questions frantically. And the 21st floor will be open by the end of the press conference. We’re gonna  "}
{"text": "answer the reporters in moderation and then head straight to the 21st floor. Do you understand?”  “Ves!”  “What a great reply... Don’t come out late.”  "}
{"text": "I heard footsteps beyond the door. Tack tack. I pulled the Holy Sword out only after I properly checked  that the Witch’s steps were far away.  "}
{"text": "And glared silently at the blade.  “Basically, besides being able to shine, there’s nothing else you’re useful for at all.”  "}
{"text": "[The Goddess of Protection is protesting against your biased opinions... ]  "}
{"text": "“Alright then. From now on, you’re not the Goddess of Protection, I’ll call you Shiny. It’s a waste for  you to have the name Holy Sword!”  Come to think of it, this Constellation was pathetic!  "}
{"text": "Didn’t she fail to protect her world and got devoured by the Devil King of Fall Rain? In the end, I had  to ‘carry’ this Constellation and protect her world. Like the vengeful ghost, this Constellation was not  in a position to raise its head against me.  "}
{"text": "“And it’s too noisy. My head’s already overloaded with one of that Sword Emperor. I’m losing my  mind because you keep going ‘Goddess of Protection’ this, ‘Goddess of Protection’ that! From now on,  don’t talk to me unless you really have to.”  "}
{"text": "[The Goddess of Protection... ]  “Ohh hoh! Don’t make me return you to the Aegim Empire. Do you understand, Shiny?”  "}
{"text": "Silence hung around for a while.  After a moment, the Holy Sword quivered.  [My Lord, Shiny agrees. ]  "}
{"text": "It was at this moment that I acquired the Constellation.  vz  "}
{"text": "The press conference was held in the square.  Not only the central square but also the alleys were packed. A crowd that looked like it easily exceeded  tens of thousands. As we walked onto the stage set up in the middle of the plaza, cameras flashed all  "}
{"text": "around us.  The Witch, Sword Saint, Me.  The three of us sat side by side at the table that was prepared beforehand.  "}
{"text": "“-Thank you for welcoming us.”  It was the Witch who spoke into the microphone. As the Witch’s calm voice flowed, cheers soared from  the corners of the plaza.  "}
{"text": "“Black Dragon Witch-nim!”  “Kyaaaaaaa!”  “Please look here, Black Dragon Witch-nim! Just once will do!”  "}
{"text": "A group of people waved their placards around. There was even a person who brought a picture of a  magazine cover that the Witch modelled for.  "}
{"text": "‘Pretty incredible.’  Was it because the Saintess(##%) had not appeared yet? As a female Hunter, Black Dragon Witch was  "}
{"text": "enjoying incomparable popularity.  After bowing her head as a sign of greeting, the Witch started the conference in all seriousness.  "}
{"text": "“As you all may know, we’ve cleared the 10th to 20th floor. It was a splendid achievement as featured  by the various media outlets, broadcasts, and even small media outlets. We’ve been wondering how to  announce this joyous news.... But it seems like we didn’t have to worry about it as you all promoted it  well. Yes, that’s right. Thank you all very much for letting us save the advertising expenses.”  "}
{"text": "There was a slight laugh from the press corps that occupied the front row of the stage.  “But there’s something else that we’re very proud of this time.”  The plaza gradually quieted down.  "}
{"text": "“Tt isn’t about the fact that the 10th floor that we’ve been longing to clear over the years has finally  come true. And neither is it related to the event of us having cleared up to the 20th floor at an  unexpected speed. Zero casualties. The fact that not a single person died... Of all things, this was what  "}
{"text": "made us happy the most.”  After a little humour, she expressed her sincere feelings.  "}
{"text": "Even to me, an outsider, I could see that the Black Dragon Witch skilfully led the conference with her  speech.  "}
{"text": "‘As expected, she has to be at this level to be the biggest guild’s leader.’  I wondered if she was really the same person who dressed me up yesterday and acted like a fool.  “Everyone. Please look down for a moment.”  "}
{"text": "Said the Witch.  “Look at the ground of Babylon’s plaza that you are stepping on. You will be able to see each stone  engraved with a name. The names of the fallen warriors thus far. The names of our seniors who devoted  "}
{"text": "their lives to clear the tower.”  We-ingggg-  The cameras of the press corps flashed across the floor in unison.  "}
{"text": "“When we raided the 2nd floor, when we raided the 3rd floor, countless names were engraved on the  floor. It is because of their sacrifices that we can be here today. In front of all these people... I’m really  happy to be able to announce this.”  "}
{"text": "The Witch’s voice resonated throughout the plaza.  “Today, we didn’t engrave anyone’s name on the plaza.”  "}
{"text": "Snap! Snap!  Reporters snapped photos alternately between the tiles on the plaza’s floor and the Witch. This would  "}
{"text": "determine the photos that will be published in the newspaper, and also decide the atmosphere and mood  of today’s conference. The crowd shouted the Witch’s name and cheered.  “There’s no need for me to even butt in.’  "}
{"text": "I watched the conference unfold with an expressionless face.  I felt gratified for no reason.  ‘As expected, siding with the right people is important.’  "}
{"text": "Feeling at ease, I glanced at the sky.  [01:22:10]  "}
{"text": "It was the same as when the 11th floor was opened. Even now, there was a clock of light in the sky.  When the number indicates 0:0:00, the 21st floor will be opened.  ‘I can’t wait to finish the press conference and go to the 21st floor...’  "}
{"text": "When the press conference was proceeding smoothly.  During the session of the reporters’ questions and the Witch’s replies.  "}
{"text": "“This is Reporter John Evans from Babylon Daily News!”  A reporter sprang on his feet.  “T have a question for Death King, the new 3rd rank.”  "}
{"text": "‘Huh? Me?’  I stared at the reporter.  "}
{"text": "Naturally, the eyes of the people who gathered in the plaza were also on me.  “There are a lot of rumours about your sudden rise in the ranking, Death King-nim. Especially the  speculation that you are the [the Big Rookie that the big guilds have been secretly raising from a long  "}
{"text": "time ago]. It sounds extremely convincing!”  UT  "}
{"text": "“Tf this is really true, then it would mean that Death King-nim is a hero intentionally created by the big  guilds. What do you think of these suspicions?”  "}
{"text": "Roaring.  There was a commotion at the plaza.  “There are also many voices of concerns that the top guilds may unite and monopolize the 10th to 20th  "}
{"text": "floors. In particular, I heard that Death King-nim has been given the exclusive rights to the 20th floor!  Is that true!”  A commotion was stirred up even further.  "}
{"text": "Tsk.  "}
{"text": "The Witch sitting next to me was expressionless, but she clicked her tongue so soft that only I could  hear it. She turned off the microphone and murmured.  “He’s trying to aggro you. Don’t answer him. I’ll take care of it.”  "}
{"text": "[T/N: aggro is like aggravating you, i.e. making you lose your cool. ]  “No.”  "}
{"text": "I shook my head.  “These kinds of people will keep popping out anyway. I’ll have to make myself clear at least once.”  "Bus.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s all right.”  I reached out my hand to the Witch.  “Please hand me the microphone.”  "}
{"text": "My determination was resolute.  Before climbing the 21st floor, I have to make sure to nip this kind of aggro in the bud.  "}

{"text": "Translator: WH Editor: Sasha  “Haihhh.”  The witch sighed anxiously.  "}
{"text": "“Don’t just blurt stuff out recklessly. Most mistakes can be covered for but if you really go all out  talking nonsense, even I can’t restrain the media.”  "}
{"text": "“There’s no one as gentle as me. You know me right. I’m the prophet, okay? I know what the most  exemplary answer is.”  "}
{"text": "“~..Can I really believe you?”  “Ayyyy, of course.”  I took over the microphone from the Witch. The Witch seemed worried about me up till the last  "}
{"text": "moment when she passed me the microphone, but it was really fine. I had a [Secret Method].  “Ah. Ah ah.”  "}
{"text": "I warmed up my voice gently. My voice resonated through the square through the speaker.  “Hello, everyone. I am a Hunter who received the nickname, Death King. Nice to meet you.”  Snap! Snap!  "}
{"text": "The flashes formed a striking wave. I wasn’t very flustered. Was yesterday’s experience of being  surrounded by a crowd a form of immunization against this? I was more relaxed than I thought and  received the ‘baptism’ of flashes head-on.  "}
{"text": "“Your name is... John Evans-nim?”  “Yes. That’s right.”  The young reporter looked straight at me. Eyes burning with the spirit of a journalist. He had a heated  "}
{"text": "gaze that looked as if he wouldn’t miss any move I made and that he would surely reveal who I really  was.  It was quite an uncomfortable gaze.  "}
{"text": "“Well.”  Meeting a gaze like that.  "}
{"text": "There was only one idea that came to my mind.  “In my opinion, it’s a voice of concern that comes from my shortfalls.”  "}
{"text": "Learn from your lessons.  [T/N: BEA GAT (Sci #8) is a Korean idiom that basically means something that allows one to learn a  lesson from a mistake, or a direct translation could be ‘One man’s trash is another man’s treasure.’ |  "}
{"text": "Let’s just not become someone like Flame Emperor!  “Huh?”  "}
{"text": "The reporter gripped the microphone with one hand and batted his eyes. He probably didn’t expect me  to react in this kind of way. Meanwhile, recalling in my head the weasel-like mug of the Flame  Emperor, | said.  "}
{"text": "[T/N: weasel in this context refers to someone who is deceitful and cunning. ]  “T’Il repeat it. In my opinion, it’s all a voice of concern that comes from my shortfalls.”  "}
{"text": "My secret move was very simple.  ‘No matter what, all I have to do is say it the other way round of how the Flame Emperor would!’  Did I look like I would have some kind of great knack for interviews?  "}
{"text": "I was different from the Witch. I didn’t have a talent at captivating the crowd with speeches. No talent,  no skills, no experience.  "}
{"text": "But, there was just one thing.  I had the knowledge that others didn’t.  "}
{"text": "The world’s most impudent Hunter’s interviews!  ‘If I did the exact opposite of what Flame Emperor did, even if I was bad at it, it’d still be decent.’  "}
{"text": "I was a big fan of the Flame Emperor for nearly a decade. Thanks to that, the inside of my head was no  different than a library. A library where the atrocities and the absurd remarks of Flame Emperor were  recorded.  "}
{"text": "What if it wasn’t me who was holding to the microphone now, but Flame Emperor?  He would have said this.  [It’s because of my greatness that we could clear through the 20th floor, you little bastards. ]  "}
{"text": "[I worked to the bones to clear the tower, y’know? So what’d you expect me to do? The items and  experiences I got there would naturally be mine. Hey, trash reporter. If I don’t fu-, if I don’t take it for  myself, then who should I give it to? Huh?]  "}
{"text": "[Your father? ]  I didn’t just made that up on the spot right now.  In fact, he really was like that!  "}
{"text": "“That was why before I returned in time, the Witch would turn pale whenever there was a press  conference...’  It was the so-called [Your father] case.  "}
{"text": "So naturally, the press conference had a brilliant outburst. The swearing sounds of the reporters were  broadcasted live, and by the time the Witch rushed to the conference, it was already too late.  "}
{"text": "It was literally a major catastrophe.  The live broadcast was stopped in a hurry, but the disaster was not over.  "}
{"text": "As Yoo Soo-ha counterfire’d the reporters, the mother of all curses and all kinds of curses that exist in  the world were thrown at him, and the scene that unfolded was broadcasted by individual streamers just  as it was.  "}
{"text": "‘His nickname wasn’t “The Plague” for no reason.’  Rumour had it that the Witch had been bedridden for a week after that day.  Perhaps due to the [Your father] incident, the Witch learned what kind of existence the Hunter Yoo  "}
{"text": "Soo-ha was. Was it not because of this incident that the top guilds distanced themselves from Yoo Soo-  ha?  ‘In the past, the Flame Emperor thoroughly screwed up this press conference.’  "}
{"text": "In other words.  ‘I just have to say the exact opposite of what the Plague said.’  "}
{"text": "Do the exact opposite of the worst, and it’d be the best!  I grabbed the microphone as I recalled Yoo Soo-ha’s absurd remarks.  [It’s because of my greatness that we could clear through the 20th floor. You little bastards. ]  "}
{"text": "“T know the public opinion is in an uproar because of me. But it’s overrated. Without the help of Black  Dragon Witch and Sword Saint here, I would’ve never been able to clear up till the 20th floor alone.”  "}
{"text": "[I worked my bones off to clear the tower, y’ know? ]  “Of course, I am proud to say that I gave it my all. Aiming at zero sacrifices, we really put in all of our  "}
{"text": "efforts, to the point of grinding our bones. But, I don’t think this can be considered as our ‘sacrifice’.  It’s what we should do as human beings. As a Hunter, this was the right thing to do. More than  anything...I did it because it’s something I like to do.”  "}
{"text": "[The items and experiences I got there would naturally be mine. Hey, trash reporter. If I don’t fu-, if I  don’t take it for myself, then who should I give it to? Huh?]  “But, just cause of that, I don’t have the intention of claiming my rights. That is why I entrusted the  "}
{"text": "rights of the 10th floor to the 19th floor to the guild masters. I only said that I wanted the 20th floor to  myself... No. The 20th floor is a kind of [Green Belt] area.

{"text": "[Your father? ]  “Reporter Evan-nim. That is all.”  “Do you still have any other questions.”  "}
{"text": "The young man who was burning with the spirit of a journalist stuttered.  “Noth-... Nothing else.”  "}
{"text": "Good.  From here, I worked my brain even faster.  "}
{"text": "If it was the Flame Emperor, what would he have responded with when he heard the reporter’s words?  [Okay. If you don’t have anything else to say, then fuck off, you American pig bastard. ]  It was a scene that I could obviously imagine happening.  In addition to this, he would’ve showed-off his bulky middle finger.  "}
{"text": "‘Let’s see. If I wanted to say the exact opposite line of this....’  I opened my mouth.  "}
{"text": "“Thank you. Ahh. If you have any other questions, I’ll answer it for a while, everyone.”  There was a moment of silence that swept through the plaza.  Though it was really just a moment of silence.  "}
{"text": "“Here here! I’m from Hwanmun Newspaper!”  “Please take our question, Death King-nim! I’m from Only Tower Daily!”  “We came from the Tower of Babel Broadcasting System!”  "}
{"text": "“Death King-nim!”  The reporters raised their hands in unison. As soon as they sensed that I was an easy-going person, they  "}
{"text": "rushed to make an article.  This scene felt like baby ducks who were diligently swaying their beaks towards the mother bird.  ‘Wow.’  "}
{"text": "I was inwardly impressed as I watched the press corps.  ‘... The learning from your lessons strategy was insane.’  "}
{"text": "As expected of the Plague. A psychopath that was shittier than anyone else in this world.  He was always the man who would become my compass in a bad sense.  Even now, the compass clearly told me how to react.  "}
{"text": "[What? Hwanmun Newspaper? I’|l never do an interview with you guys, There’s nothing but old  baffoons there. Even when I flip open the newspaper, it gives off a geezer smell. Hey, if you’re gonna  call yourself a reporter, at least shower. ]  "}
{"text": "Again, I recalled the words of Flame Emperor and said,  "}
{"text": "“_,.Then, starting from the reporter of Hwanmun Newspaper.”  The effect was magnificent.  "}
{"text": "The conference ended on a good note. It was literally a great success. Questions and answers popped  up from everywhere for over an hour, but I didn’t make a common slip of the tongue.  "}
{"text": "In actual fact, it wasn’t easy to end the conference on a good note. The reporters shot vague questions  at me to somehow extract even one line of extra information so they could put it in their articles. In the  end, the Witch took over my microphone and said a simple thankful greeting.  "}
{"text": "“Everyone! I understand your desire of wanting to know more about our new hero. Unfortunately, there  is little time left.” The Witch pointed at the sky with her finger.  [00:05:27]  "}
{"text": "Before we knew it, the clock of light was close to 00:00:00.  There were only 5 minutes left until the new stage opened!  "}
{"text": "There was no better excuse than this to be used to end the press conference.  “We will end our night’s rest here, and concentrate on clearing the tower again today.

{"text": "zero casualties.”  “Ahbhhbhbhh....”  "}
{"text": "There were regrettable bellows popping out from here and there.  As I wondered if the press conference would end just like this, a brave figure raised his hand.  “Black, Black Dragon Witch! One last question please!”  "}
{"text": "“Yes. With this one question, the conference will really end here.”  “Black Dragon Witch and Death King! What is the relationship between the two of you?!”  At that moment, people’s eyes shined.  "}
{"text": "Pure interest. Slight mischief.  Since the dawn of history, the one thing that humans have been most curious about was the story of  love. The reporters probably wanted to match up the Witch and me in that kind of way.  "}
{"text": "“Hmmmm...”  The Witch thought for a while, then glanced back at me.  "}
{"text": "Should I say it was something like a mischievous prank?  There was a faint playfulness in the Witch’s eyes.  “The relationship between the two of us... That’s right.”  The Witch slowly opened her lips.  "}
{"text": "Then, a statement that would remain as a famous line of the era came out of her mouth.  "}
{"text": "“-A more than friend, comrade-in-arms kind of relationship.”  Fluttering fluttering.  The reporters cheered. Should they focus on the word more than a friend? Should they focus on the  "}
{"text": "word comrade-in-arms (#7/<)? Either way, it was a mood where they were unable to make out the  heads or tails of what they were told.  The reporter who asked the question also widened his eyes.  "}
{"text": "“Frie-, a more than a friend relationship, is what you’re trying to say right?”  “Who knows.”  The Witch leisurely uttered.  "}
{"text": "“T’Il repeat it again, it’s a ‘more than a friend, comrade-in-arms’ kind of relationship, That’s all there is  to it. I hope there are no misunderstandings and misinterpretations.”  "}

{"text": "I could hear the sound of a book flipping open somewhere. At the same time, the cloud of dust  disappeared. The destroyed city disappeared. The split earth disappeared, and the torn sky disappeared.  "}

{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong muttered as if it was strange.  I was surprised at the fact that Bae Hu-ryeong had met Lefanta Aegim before.  “What does Constellation Killer mean?’  "}

{"text": "The world as they knew it was collapsing, yet the two Righteous and Demonic sect people had no  intentions of stopping their war.  "}
{"text": "This alone was enough to render me speechless, but... There was a separate scene that was even more  shocking.  It was the scene of the two fighting.  "}
{"text": "“The scholar does not cover his brush, and the warrior does not cover his sword.”  The Heavenly Demon said to the Murim Lord.  The wooden stick was still in her hands.  "}
{"text": "“Although the great me is only holding a wooden stick upon forgetting to bring a sword, I can still send  an old man like you beyond the yellow river.”  "}
{"text": "“Come on then!”  The Murim Lord held his cane and shouted vehemently.  "}
{"text": "“Let’s fight for the last time and determine who will lead the Righteous and Demonic sects once and  for all!”  Thus the two Righteous and Demonic sect people clashed.  "}
{"text": "Perhaps the term “confrontation” was a little too much.  The two people’s tactics were nothing more than mere drabbing.  "}
{"text": "“Heavenly Demon Limbo (K/ie# fae)!”  "}
{"text": "[T/N: Basically the leader of the demonic cult. Cheonma is the heavenly demon]  “Huh! Sky Piercing Yellow Moon!(#¢ M f&X)!”  The Heavenly Demon and the Murim Sect Lord faced off with fairly specious words. But that was all  "}
{"text": "there was to it.  What the two people had in their hands were only wooden canes, and the sound of them clashing was  rhythmic and cheerful.  "}
{"text": "Bam! Bam! Bam!  "}
{"text": "Their canes broke even before the climax of their fight. Then the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord  rushed at each other, with a fierce glare in their eyes. The Heavenly Demon caught the Murim Lord’s  beard, and the latter grabbed her by the hair.  "}
{"text": "I was speechless.  “What the hell is this...”  And then it got more interesting.  "}
{"text": "With all of us dumbfounded,  -Oh, that’s weird.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong gave an unusual response.  -They’ve got the right posture. Those guys.  ‘What?’  "}
{"text": "-They’re breathing properly with correct movements. Even in my world, they’d be considered masters.  I looked at the duel again. The Murim Lord was about to poke the eyes of the Heavenly Demon, and  "}
{"text": "the latter was hurriedly covering her face with both hands.  ‘Those two?’  "}
{"text": "-You don’t know that fundamental principle? That Divine Dragon’s claw poking the eyes is trying to  steal the Vile Dragon’s pearl can be called Two Dragons Fighting for a Pearl (i ## #4). And that  one defending his face can be assimilated to Buddha covering the faces of the humankind and can be  called Thousand Sound Observing (7 zt #7)...  "}
{"text": "[T/N: the first one refers to a Chinese myth where fairies were bathing in the heavenly pond and got  attacked by demons but were rescued by 2 dragons.

{"text": "(Face covering = closing eyes = relief from suffering) ]  Thus went Bae Hu-ryeong’s explanation.  "}
{"text": "I raised one hand to block the last of it.  ‘But why are they having a dog fight in such a sloppy manner?’  "}

{"text": "The Sword Emperor smacked me.  -No, damnit, can you really not see that? of all things I had to go into closed-doors cultivation and  draw out my form and thought with my drained aura. Tsk tsk. well, I guess that’s why I needed you in  "}
{"text": "the first place...  Spending many years behind closed doors cultivation upon fighting the Devil King of Fall Rain was  only natural. Anyway, the Sword Emperor was serious.  "}
{"text": "And there was one more serious person.  “That old woman... she’s pretty good.”  The Poisonous Snake was squinting his eyes.  "}
{"text": "“That bite is following the principle of the Jiwangsa, and that arm strike follows the principle of  Onwolyong.”  "}
{"text": "-Heeya, he says he’s “real,” but I guess a warrior is still a warrior. Yes, like a giant snake biting the  King of the Earth, and then going on with a dragon-like skin. Did you see that zombie? Unlike you, I  have eyes that see through everything.  "}
{"text": "I went through the Venomous Snake’s thoughts silently  Chen Mu-mun Master was seriously thinking with his arms folded.  [If I were to analyze it with my [Unrivaled under the heaven] skill... I’d say it’s right. |  "}

{"text": "-Yes, thank you...  "}
{"text": "Fortunately, this strange scene in which the Murim Lord and the Heavenly Demon were having a  dogfight, the Emperor of Light novels coming to a realization while watching that, and above all, this  strange scene in which I consoled the Sword Emperor, did not last long.  "}
{"text": "“Achoo! Aigoo I’m freezing to death!”  The Medicine King screamed.  “Hey, you bastard and wench! How long are you going to be fighting? Can’t you see us in front of you?  "}
{"text": "Tsk tsk, look look, what a narrow-sighted pair! You’re just like young children, exactly like young  children!”  They stopped at the Medicine King’s deafening roar.  "}
{"text": "The Murim Lord scratched the back of his head with an embarrassed face.  “Well, we haven’t had a visitor in a long while. Surely this is not the proper behavior to exhibit.”  The Heavenly Demon also coughed awkwardly.  "}
{"text": "“For now, I will guide you to the cave, where the great me is staying.”  "}
{"text": "It wasn’t long before the dark clouds cleared up. I no longer needed Shiny to light the way.  The zombies were again as hard as stone in the sun, and we were able to escape the snowfield safely.  “Huff, huff...”  "}
{"text": "“Oh... haah...!”  However, the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord. The poor physical strength of the two people was  a hindrance.  "}
{"text": "The two of them were obviously not ordinary Righteous and Demonic sect people, but the heads of the  Demonic Cult and the Righteous Cult. They were the ones who had to show off that they had this  world’s most powerful martial arts. The Sword Emperor and Chen Mu-mun Master even guaranteed  "}
{"text": "their military service through different arguments.  And yet somehow... The two people were totally out of shape.  "}
{"text": "They were gasping for breath even though they had only walked a little in the snow.  “Uhm.”  I said discreetly because I couldn’t stand seeing it.  "}
{"text": "“Can I give you a piggyback, if you don’t mind?”  "}
{"text": "“Plea, please. It’s not easy to practice Mind Control (72) today.”  "}
{"text": "In the end, as I did earlier, I carried the Heavenly Demon, and the Venomous Snake carried the Murim  Lord.  The Venomous Snake said solemnly.  "}
{"text": "“Death King. That’s not right.”  “What?”  "}
{"text": "“This is how it should be.”  “Tt is only right this way.”  “Yes...”  "}
{"text": "I didn’t have the strength to argue, so I decided to go along with it.  It was then.  ‘Huh?’  "}
{"text": "I was seized by a strange feeling as I was carrying the Murim Lord and walking.  ‘It’s strange.’  Bae Hu-ryeoung tilted its head.  "}
{"text": "-What’s weird?  ‘He feels warm.’  "}
{"text": "-Hm?  ‘...His body feels very warm. But isn’t the weather so cold now? If we don’t use our Aura we'll freeze.  But he’s so warm.’  "}
{"text": "The Sword Emperor looked thoughtful and silent. I followed his example and was lost in thought.  "}
{"text": "Is he protecting his body with his Aura just like we’re doing? But why didn’t I feel a single speck of  internal energy from his attacks in the battle that just took place then?  ‘What is it? Things don’t add up.’  "}
{"text": "Something was strange.  But as I was failing to notice exactly what was strange, we crossed the snowfield.  "}
{"text": "“This is the home of the great me.”  The cave that the Heavenly Horse pointed at was not far from the snowfield.  There was a wide hole in the ceiling, and the glow of the sunset poured in.  "}
{"text": "“Wow....”  The Alchemist’s mouth was wide open with shock. Her eyes glistened over the frosted spectacles.  “T-It’s a hot spring, isn’t it?”  "}
{"text": "There was an open-air bath in the cave.  A deep pond had settled on the bottom of the cave. Water vapor rose from the surface of the pond. The  "}
{"text": "natural hot spring was supposed to overcome the freezing cold and warm the surroundings with the  consolation of sunset. With the hot spring flowing down, I thought it was a beautiful sight.  “The great me had found it a long time ago.”  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon smiled like she was glad.  “T didn’t expect to welcome strangers from the Sae-Wae as guests. Wash first. Ill look for food to serve  you in addition to drinking water with that oldie.”  "}
{"text": "“Huh. Is there anything else we can serve other than energy bars?”  “Didn’t I say let’s go look for something? Old man, are your ears deafening as you age?”  "}
{"text": "“Old man, old man, old man,... you always call me that, but if you look at it, there’s not much age  difference between you and me!”  "}
{"text": "“If you’re offended, then you should’ve also grown some wisdom instead of getting old in vain.”  The Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord wobbled away to the other end of the cave.  We stayed in the hot springs and looked at the two with curious eyes.  "}
{"text": "“Th, that’s amazing. They were engaged in a life-or-death battle just a while ago...”  They had been fighting for three years. There must be some affection or respect they grew for each  other while fighting.”  "}
{"text": "The Medicine King grumbled.  "}
{"text": "“But it’s warm and nice around here. Eey. As soon as I came to this world, I was so embarrassed to  hold a man’s hand. Now get away from me a little, Chemu-mun Master.”  “How did the Sword Saint become friends with someone like you?”  "}
{"text": "“Oho! Get your facts right. I allowed Marcus to become friends with me!”  “What the... Well, I guess you and the Sword Saint are both weirdos. Frick, you’re two of a kind.”  So we went into the open-air bath and took a rest.  "}
{"text": "After we finished taking a bath, the two Righteous and Demonic sect people served us food.  “Well, I don’t think we have any other food to serve you.”  “Tt’s an energy seed. Eat lots.”  "}
{"text": "What the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord served us were kernel beads. It was Hwan (JL).  /* 'T/N: Hwan is a round medicinal pill that is made from natural substances. */  It looked like Cheongsimhwan, but the grain was a little bigger.  "}

{"text": "catch. I don’t even know how the world came to be like this.”  “No, thanks for your hospitality.”  "}
{"text": "I received the plate politely. It had been three years since the world collapsed. There’s no way there’d  be any other type of food around.  "}
{"text": "Our party carefully nibbled at the Hwan.  “Blegh!”  “Ugh.”  "}
{"text": "The Venomous Snake and the Medicine King had a constipated face on. I almost coughed, too. The old  beans tasted raw. They could barely be considered as food.  “You haven’t really been surviving on this, have you...>?”  "}
{"text": "The Alchemist picked up the Hwan and looked around as if she were amazed.  “Almost so.”  “For, for how long?”  "}
{"text": "“Uhm.”  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon stared at the cave wall. The wall was inscribed with numerous calendar  markings. Perhaps the two had kept track of the date one stroke a day when they began to live in this  cave.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s been more than two years since we’ve been eating only the Hwan.”  “2 years...”  The Alchemist was speechless. Two years... They said they had eaten only grains for two years.  "}
{"text": "The Alchemist groaned as if it was difficult for her to understand this.  “Th-That’s ridiculous. Then you won’t be able to get proper nutrition. Without proper coordination of  sugars and lipids, proteins, and vitamins and minerals, the human body...”  "}
{"text": "“Hmm? I don’t know what you mean, but it’s still edible.”  “T can’t stand it!”  The Medicine King shouted back.  "}
{"text": "Standing up suddenly, the Medicine King took something out of his pocket. He pulled out all sorts of  things, like bummers, meat, seafood, and so on.  "}
{"text": "“Watch and learn, you idiots! Tch tch, you don’t even have the energy to cross the snowfield. You not  thinking about your bodies is the same as when I was young. Is there any water?”  "}
{"text": "“Oh, the water, we melt snow and drink it, or once in a while, when the sun shines for a few days in a  row, water runs through the stone in there....”  “Tt’s driving me crazy. It’s driving me crazy. 70% of the human body is water, but you drink that kind  "}
{"text": "of water occasionally. You need to drink water that is full of minerals...”  The Medicine King, who set fire to a burner, took out bottled water and poured it into the pot.  The Alchemist was surprised to see the bottled water.  "}
{"text": "“You’re using Bling H2O, aren’t you? That expensive thing...”  “What’s so expensive about this? It’s good for cooking, so I just use it. When I was outside the tower, I  couldn’t even see water. Tch tch, if it weren’t for Marcus...”  "}
{"text": "The Medicine King tilted his head over the cooking pot that he pulled out of nowhere.  -Hey zombie. What’s a Bling H20?  "}
{"text": "“Well, maybe it’s like Evian.’  -What is Evian? Is that some kind of Elixir of Life?  ‘What’s an Elixir of Life?’  "}

{"text": "“This shrimp. It’s plump and solid. And even though it tastes like shrimp... There’s no fish odor... H,  how can shrimp taste like this? In addition, the mille-feuille served for this dessert tastes like the  nobility of Nuneddine[1]. And not just regular nobility but a high ranking noble. The yogurt ice cream  underneath is fresh and seems to be mixed with passion fruit juice, so it feels refreshingly sour... H,  how does it taste this good?”  "}
{"text": "The Medicine King’s nose haughtily pointed upward.  "}

{"text": "Could it be that the Medicine King wasn’t just good at making some medicine but was actually a really  amazing person?  Was he not bluffing about Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and being a boxing champion?  "}

{"text": "Instead of asking me what I wanted to check, the Sword Emperor shut his mouth. He must have  guessed it.  "}
{"text": "That guess was probably the same as mine.  I pulled the blanket up to my face. Then, I closed my eyes and pretended that I had fallen asleep.  The night deepened.  "}
{"text": "Srrk—.  I felt someone approaching. It wasn’t just one presence. There were two. I quietly held my breath  without opening my eyes. The two of them lingered around us and whispered in very small voices.  "}
{"text": "“_,.Are they asleep?”  “_..T believe so.”  "}
{"text": "“~.. Then let’s do it now. Hurry up.”  “_..That’s right. Let’s finish it quickly.”  "}
{"text": "The voices of the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord.  The sound gradually moved farther away from us. Splash. I heard the sounds of water. The two Murim  people started taking a bath just after all of us fell asleep.  "}
{"text": "‘It’s now.’  Hwik!  "}
{"text": "I got up in a flash and ran toward the open-air bath. Beyond the thick vapor. The Heavenly Demon and  the Murim Lord were wearing white mourning clothes in the bath. They were enjoying the hot spring  with languid faces and were surprised to see me suddenly run in.  "}
{"text": "“Huh!?”  The Murim Lord dunked himself in the bath. The old man could not hide his embarrassment.  Of course.  "}
{"text": "Looking at their bodies, I was convinced that my predictions were correct.  “Wh, what?! You! I thought you were asleep!”  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon narrowed her eyes. She seemed to understand the situation a little faster than the  old man. Sighing lightly, she looked at me quietly.  "}
{"text": "“_..This child is quick on the uptake. When did you realize it?”  “T thought it was a bit weird from the first time I saw you.”  I opened my mouth.  "}
{"text": "“The weather was so cold, but the two of you were dressed lightly. One was wearing only a martial arts  uniform, and the other was wearing a small mourning outfit.”  The weather outside was freezing.  "}
{"text": "If you didn’t use Aura, you couldn’t survive at all.  In such a powerfully cold climate, the Murim people in front of us had worn clothes that were no  different from being naked.  "}
{"text": "“Tt meant that you were protecting your bodies from the cold by circulating your life energy. In other  words, it meant that you are highly skilled at manipulating your life energy... But how could such  skilled people get tired from small fights or walking a little? It was strange.”  "}
{"text": "I said slowly,  “There is only one explanation for this. The two of you are focusing all your efforts on other work.”  "}
{"text": "“You told us just a little while ago that once bitten by Jiangshi, a person’s whole body will be stained  with takgi.”  "}
{"text": "I looked straight through the water vapor at the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord.  “You two have already been bitten, correct?”  “T think it’s like this. Heavenly Demon-nim and Murim Lord-nim. Both of you were infected by the  "}
{"text": "Jiangshi a long time ago. But with your magic and martial arts, you’re holding back the takgi with  tremendous effort. Am I wrong?”  The silence settled in the open-air bath.  "}
{"text": "Splash.  I heard the sound of water being shaken off, and soon, the Heavenly Demon stood up.  “Ma, Madu. You...”  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s fine. Old man. Haven’t we been completely figured out already?”  The Heavenly Demon shook her head.  “Child of the outside world. Your words are right.”  "}
{"text": "She turned her back toward me.  The pure white back of the Heavenly Demon.  "}
{"text": "“The old man and I were already bitten by the Jiangshi three years ago.”  There was a scar that was rotting and purple.  The Murim Lord also slowly showed the back of his neck.  "}
{"text": "“But, strictly speaking, there is one part of your words that is wrong.”  Likewise, there was a rotting wound there.  "}
{"text": "However, the wound stopped at the neck.  “We’re not suppressing the takgi.”  "}
{"text": "Above the neck, there was a clean, human face.  With that clean face, the Murim Lord said,  “We blocked the takgi by blocking the cervical part of our spinal cord with our life energy.”  "}

{"text": "“Children of the outside world.”  The Heavenly Demon glanced back.  "}
{"text": "We left the cave and arrived at yesterday’s fields of snow... We were walking to a place surrounded by  zombies who knew martial arts.  “Can you guess how that high master died?”  "}
{"text": "“How did he die>?”  “He died because of a succubus.”  The corner of the Heavenly Demon’s mouth rose.  "}
{"text": "“The pleasure of uniting yin and yang is not poison. It’s not a sword, either.’  "}
{"text": "“Uh. But isn’t excessive pleasure also a poison?”  “Correct. Thus, the succubus did not offer a storm of pleasure from the beginning. She was clever. She  calmly took her time. At first, she started with the most subtle pleasure... In the end, he indulged in  "}

{"text": "Zombies were scattered everywhere in the snowy field. Was it because they had chased our party  yesterday? The Heavenly Demon approached the zombies.  "}
{"text": "“Most of the novices who set out to learn martial arts don’t understand. They think the goal of martial  artists is to become invincible, and that the reason for learning martial arts is to obtain immortality and  eternal life.”  "}
{"text": "With a quick breath, the Demon hoisted up a zombie.  “They’re wrong.”  The Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord. The two lifted and carried the zombies.  "}
{"text": "“Anyone who has achieved the Thousand Poisons Immunity will die from something other than poison.  Those who achieve the Stone Durability will die by something other than a sword. Do you understand?  Martial artists don’t simply choose which martial arts to learn.”  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon arduously moved the zombies.  “Tt’s about choosing what kind of warrior you will live as, and also how you will die.”  The Heavenly Demon’s movement as she moved the zombies was sluggish and slow.  "}

{"text": "She repeated those words.  “As if we didn’t know that already. How can we be bitter about the fact that we’ll die?”  Last night the zombies seemed to have wandered about here and there. The scattered zombies were  "}

{"text": "The two of them had poor physical strength, and there were too many bodies.  “Assassination is good. Poisoning is also good. It is also good to be attacked by an army, or be killed  by one of the Shaolin monks. It is good to die, betrayed by a trusted subordinate, and it is perfectly  "}
{"text": "good to die while doing something for the younger generation.”  Middle of the sky.  "}
{"text": "By the time the Demon and the Murim Lord put the zombies back in their place, the sun rose to the  middle of the sky. Before we knew it, the footprints of the two people were captured in the snowy field.  "}
{"text": "“But, a death like this is unacceptable.”  The Heavenly Demon took a quick breath and looked at me.  “You asked me how I endured it.”  "}
{"text": "“We just want to die the way we want.”  Hundreds of corpses, the sect’s elders, were lined up.  Hundreds of corpses, the members of the Demonic Cult, were lined up as well.  "}
{"text": "Thus, the zombies seemed like an army divided into two troops, as if they were about to run into battle.

{"text": "“The people of our cult will not be destroyed, eaten by mere corpses.”  Even if the Nine Great Schools and Five Noble Clans disappeared.  "}
{"text": "“Surely, if our sect is to be destroyed, it must be because of the wicked fingertips of Demonic Cult.”  Even if the martial arts texts became so dusty that it became impossible to read the words.  “If this cult disappears from the world, it is only by the blade of that sect.”  "}
{"text": "This world had not yet perished.  Because these two people have to die in order for the world to end.  "}
{"text": "Let’s say that there are a billion people in the world, and 999,999,999 people die of infectious diseases.  There’s only one person left. And if the last person in the world takes his own life, then the destruction  of the world won’t be caused by an illness—it’ll be suicide.  "}
{"text": "At least, that’s what the Righteous Sect’s leader and the Demonic Cult’s god believed.  “Murim Lord. Namgung Family, Taesang Family Head. Namgung Un.”  The old man took his stance.  "}
{"text": "“T am Bu Wol-sun, the Ax Saint.”  “Demon lord. So Baek-hyang.”  The woman took her stance.  "}
{"text": "“T am the Heavenly Demon.”  The sun crossed the middle of the sky.  "}

{"text": "“To the death.”  “T accept.”  "}
{"text": "The two fighters began their battle.  In the middle of the snowy field where five hundred Righteous Sect members and five hundred  Demonic Cult’s members stood, the Murim Lord and the Heavenly Demon rushed at each other.  "}
{"text": "I still couldn’t recognize the martial arts of the two. When I looked at them, they were barely stepping  forward. It was hard. They could barely reach their arms out.  "}
{"text": "Their foot movements were so slow that they wouldn’t even be able to catch a child.  Their hand movements were weak, and they would not be able to crush even a single tangerine.  A decaying genre.  "}
{"text": "A decaying world.  They were slowly dying in this apocalypse, well into its 990th day.  “This...”  "}
{"text": "I opened my mouth.  I watched their dances from afar and muttered unknowingly.  "}
{"text": "“Tt can’t go on like this.”  My heart was beating.  “Tt’s absurd.”  "}
{"text": "“Tt wasn’t supposed to be like this.”  A fierce fight broke out in the snow. The Murim Lord and the Demon, who once demonstrated splendid  "}
{"text": "martial arts while discussing the first people in the world, could now only fight on the level of a child.  They rolled about in the snow. They tripped from taking a wrong step. They grabbed a beard and pulled  their hair.  "}
{"text": "“In the eyes of the Sword Emperor, that might look like a really great fight. Yes. I’m just a beginner  who just started swordsmanship. However, no matter how great the principle is, no matter how great  the hidden reason is...”  "}
{"text": "The day had passed, and it became evening.  The Murim Lord and the Heavenly Demon never stopped fighting.  “This is an insult.”  "}
{"text": "The sun went down.  Even today, the match was not decided.  “Tt’s an insult to the two.”  "}
{"text": "A world in decline.  In a world where there was no way to cure an epidemic, the two martial artists were strong enough to  "}
{"text": "survive. However, they were too weak to take each other’s lives.  “This can’t go on.”  "}
{"text": "The world was cruel because you can’t be born the way you want. So what was a world where you  can’t die the way you want?  "}
{"text": "You couldn’t even end it properly.  Their lives had just been cut off in the middle.  -What will you do?  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong said quietly.  -Will you kill the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord in their stead? That’s right. That can be a  merciful gift, too. That’s what I would do. But don’t forget that you and I are nothing more than  "}
{"text": "‘strangers.’  “T know.”  "}
{"text": "The two martial artists did not want to commit suicide.  If they had to die, then they wanted their deaths to be at the hands of the other person.  The Demonic Cult would not perish due to a mysterious illness but be defeated by the Righteous Sect.  "}
{"text": "The Righteous Sect would not succumb to an infectious disease, but be broken by the Demonic Cult.  It was that kind of ending.  The right ending.  "}
{"text": "An acceptable death.  If I intrude and kill the two, it will neither be the [end] nor the [conclusion]. It wouldn’t be a merciful  gift, either.  "}
{"text": "That sort of thing would only be [graffiti] that a child adds to the back of a storybook.  It shouldn’t be that way.  "}
{"text": "“T am,” I said to Bae Hu-ryeong. “I am going to finish this world in my own way.”  -What is that way?  I did not answer Bae Hu-ryeong’s question.  "}
{"text": "The sun set.  “T, it’s already night time. Old man.”  “Maybe since it’s winter... Huh. The day is short...”  "}
{"text": "“T’ll defeat you tomorrow for sure.”  “Who do you think...”  "}
{"text": "The evening deepened.  The 990th day of the war naturally ended in a truce.  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord shook hands, and they went back to the cave in a more  exhausted way than yesterday.  "}
{"text": "“Where have you been?”  The party greeted us.  "}
{"text": "The Venomous Snake stood guard at the entrance to the cave, and the Alchemist and the Medicine King  were busy researching the zombie. It was the zombie of the faction leader who surprised us yesterday.  “We were looking at the patient. We were too busy yesterday...”  "}

{"text": "“Yes... S-since this is the first virus of its kind.”  As expected.  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord walked to the other side of the cave, saying they would rest  first. I noticed that the backs of the two fighters were moving away and turned to the Alchemist.  "}
{"text": "“Boss.”  “Yes?”  “Please be honest. How long do you think it would take to make a cure?”  "}
{"text": "“Ah. Um, uh.”  The Alchemist hesitated.  “To be honest with you... At least 120 days.”  "}
{"text": "“Twice that. It may take three times more. The schedule for this sort of thing should be more generous,  usually. But even if you have a generous schedule, it isn’t enough,” the Medicine King added bluntly.  The Alchemist drooped down her head.  "}
{"text": "“_.. Yes, that is also right. It’s really the worst case... .”  Mm.  "}
{"text": "“100 days on the shorter end. And on the longer end, about 300 days?”  “Uh. that...”  The Alchemist dropped his head even lower.  "}
{"text": "“A, actually, we may not be able to make it at all. The facilities and the environment are also poor. At  this point, I can’t guarantee you anything. Death King-nim. I’m sorry...

{"text": "Now was not the time to worry about fine manners.  I just need good returns on my investment in the future.  sheds I understand.”  "}
{"text": "The Alchemist fixed her glasses.  She turned her head and looked at the Medicine King.  “Sin”  "}
{"text": "“Hmm? What.”  “From now on, please support me with your full strength.”  The Medicine King frowned. The old man’s wrinkles were as thick as his stubbornness.  "}
{"text": "“Support? Suppooort? Have you seen such a horrible thing? Yes, this. Even cold water has order to it!  Top and bottom! How dare this greenhorn ask the Medicine King to support her...”  "}
{"text": "“Skill card open.”  “...Huh?”  Cards sprang out from the Alchemist’s hand.  "}
{"text": "One golden card. Three silver cards.  The Alchemist acquired four skills that were difficult to obtain for an ordinary hunter. Furthermore, she  only had advanced skills that were B grade or higher.  "}
{"text": "The Medicine King’s eyes widened into circles.  "}
{"text": "“W, what is this? Are you trying to show off your skills to me? Hey. Young’uns think that everything  can be done with just skills. You don’t know what true ability is...”  The Alchemist replied,  "}
{"text": "“You can look at it.”  “What?”  "}
{"text": "“You can look at what my skills are.”  The Medicine King was embarrassed and couldn’t respond right away.  "}
{"text": "It was natural. Skills were secret weapons for Hunters. Any savvy Hunter knew that they should never  let others learn their skills. Revealing skills was like confessing not only one’s own strengths but also  one’s weaknesses.  "}
{"text": "In a word, it was pure stupidity. A dumb and foolish act.  “Or should I just show it to you myself?”  However, the Alchemist did not hesitate.  "}
{"text": "“This skill is called [Moving Hospital].”  She turned the card over and showed it to the Medicine King.  "}
{"text": "“Everything from a blood test to an EEG test is possible in real time. I can also take out and use the  drugs I store in advance. However, there is a 2% chance of a misdiagnosis. This is [Life Diagnosis]. It  shows me a patient’s condition in terms of genes. I can combine the two skills to minimize the  probability of a misdiagnosis...”  "}
{"text": "“W, wait a moment! Wait just a minute!”  The Medicine King belatedly caught up his thoughts.  "}
{"text": "“You! Why are you showing me your skills!? What if I expose this to the Alchemy Castle or to my  business partners!”  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s all right. I swore that I wouldn’t care about such petty thoughts,” the Alchemist said. “If you want  to make it public, do it. But please support me this time until we make a treatment.”  “No, but why are you asking me...”  "}
{"text": "“Because I need you to speed up development time, even if it’s just by a day.”  “You hate looking at me, right?”  "}
{"text": "The Alchemist looked at the Medicine King. It was a calm, cold look. The Alchemist used to be  flustered often, but now her face was completely expressionless.  "}
{"text": "“Are you angry because this “young’un’ doesn’t know about the topic? It must be annoying that  someone like me has talent, right? You’re annoyed like crazy because you know I’m going to live  longer than you and be admired by people for longer than you, right?”  "}
{"text": "The human voice is often compared to that of a bird. But I bet the Alchemist’s voice could not be  imitated by any beast. To put it frankly, it was like this. Her voice reminded me of a bug.  It was like the sizzle of a fire ant colony.  "}
{"text": "“If you can help me with your utmost power this time.”  The Alchemist fixed her glasses.  “The medicine recipes I have made so far. I’ll give you everything. I won’t go anywhere or tell them  "}
{"text": "they’re my recipes. You can have them. Use them. Tell people that it’s a recipe you invented—”  At that moment, the Alchemist’s glasses slipped and fell to the floor.  The old man had slapped her on the cheek.  "}
{"text": "The Alchemist picked up her glasses. Then, she silently wiped the glasses with her sleeves. A red  handprint remained on her left cheek. The Alchemist put on her glasses again, then silently looked at  the old man.  "}
{"text": "The old man trembled.  “You wicked thing...”  "}
{"text": "“T will analyze the zombie virus.”  “You will learn that there is a sky above the sky.”  “Sir, please do the things I tell you to do.”  "}
{"text": "“The day will come when your pride will be crushed and you will exude a rotten odor.”  “T’ll write down what I need and give it to you.”  “Someday you too—”  "}
{"text": "“At that time, sir—”  The old man and the woman spoke at the same time.  “You will meet someone better than you.”  "}
{"text": "“Find it and give it to me.”  And the two Hunters fell silent.  "}
{"text": "The Alchemist on the left and the Medicine King on the right sat on either side of the corpse of the  faction leader. When the Alchemist muttered something, the Medicine King wrote it down. It was a  neutral, muted atmosphere. The two, who became more of a still life art than a portrait, only conversed  about business.  "}
{"text": "“Death King-nim. I’m sorry, but please leave,” the Alchemist mumbled, cutting into the corpse’s head  with a surgical knife.  "}
{"text": "“The sound of your breath is disturbing me. A lot. It’s very, very disturbing.”  “Go and catch six more zombies while you’re out.”  "}
{"text": "The Medicine King peered into the corpse’s dark mouth. The Medicine King pinched the zombie’s  tongue, stained purple and black, with his tongs.  “T need more samples. A kid. A young adult. An old person. Each with a different gender. And if there  "}
{"text": "are any medicinal herbs that I say I need, get them.  I nodded.  "}
{"text": "“Leave it to me.”  From that day.  We went into a state of war.  "}
{"text": "Even eating was a waste of time. Washing one’s body was a luxury. Even though there was an open-air  bath right next to us, the Alchemist and the Medicine King did not take a bath. Whether it was night or  day, the two Hunters only studied the zombies while cracking at the edge of the wall.  "}
{"text": "“Uh-huh... The atmosphere has changed drastically.”  The Heavenly Demon looked at our party as if she were curious.  "}
{"text": "“Are you trying to gain enlightenment? Young people sure are eager.”  “Why don’t you cook the clam soup or risotto?”  The Murim Lord coaxed the Medicine King.  "}
{"text": "“Tt was so skillful that even the imperial family’s chef would cry. If the world was fine, I would have  appointed you as the chef of the Daenam palace.”  "}
{"text": "“I’m busy. Buzz off,” the Medicine King replied without raising his head. He only put one hand in his  subspace pocket and threw a water bottle.  “If you’re hungry, fill yourself up with water.”  "}
{"text": "“Knngg.”  Was it that regrettable that he couldn’t taste the Medicine King’s dishes? The Murim Lord smacked his  lips. Even so, he caught the Bling H20 thrown by the Medicine King and drank it all.  "}
{"text": "“Old man. Don’t bother busy people. Let’s go.”  "}
{"text": "“All right, all right. Oh, I’m having a hard time because my body doesn’t listen to me these days.”  The Murim Lord grumbled as if he was tired.  “Today again, how much have the Jiangshi scattered...”  "}
{"text": "“Would those who stray far away go to heaven? Stop talking and come out.”  “T’m coming.”  The Murim Lord grumbled and left the cave with the Heavenly Demon.  "}
{"text": "Like yesterday, they were trying to collect and line up zombies. To spend the 991th day of the great  war.  "}
{"text": "A day had passed.  The day when this world would reach its end became one day closer.  Another day had passed.  "}
{"text": "Another day.  Again, another day passed by.  "}
{"text": "Countdown.  Days just waiting for destruction.  A world in a music box that just hadn’t stopped yet.  "}
{"text": "“Hmm.”  One week.  "}
{"text": "Just a week had passed since we fell into the Apocalypse.  That day, the Heavenly Demon looked up at the ceiling of the cave.  sipwiests We can’t go outside today.”  "}
{"text": "Outside, a blizzard was raging. The wind blew and blew again, so there was no distinction between the  top and the bottom, and the sky and the earth.  "}
{"text": "The world was a dark snowfield.  This was the first time I learned that something white could become this dark.  “Well. Some days are just like this.”  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon just shrugged her shoulders, as if saying that it was no problem.  “Rather, it was a fluke that the days were sunny for the past few days. In severe cases, it could be a  "}
{"text": "complete whiteout for over 30 days. There was no sunlight, so we couldn’t even take a step.”  “Then, the Jiangshi will continue to move,” I said.  "}
{"text": "“Will that be all right? If the Jiangshi go too far, you won’t be able to recover them.”  “Tn that case, it can’t be helped. We lose them.”  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon sighed.  “Just three years ago, our school’s power reached 1,000. That’s about the same amount of people that  the old man brought into his sect. But as the years passed, there were Jiangshi that went so far that we  "}
{"text": "couldn’t find them at all.”  Of course.  "}
{"text": "The missing corpses. No. Not missing, but lost bodies. Every time a blizzard struck in the sky, the  Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord would have lost some of their Jiangshi.  "}
{"text": "“That must be the scariest thing.”  “Hm?”  “To wake up and go to the snowfield just to discover that some Jiangshi had disappeared somewhere.”  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon looked at me quietly.  “Do you think that I would feel scared?”  The woman’s eyes were dark.  "}
{"text": "Her hair as well. Even the clothes that she wore.  Her appearance, which was only black, seemed to desperately resist this world that had become a pure  "}
{"text": "white snowfield.  “Yes. I think so.”  "}
{"text": "“Surely the world has turned over a lot. Back then, the head of a man who talked like that would not be  safe. Child of the outside world. You should consider yourself fortunate that the world is ruined.”  "}
{"text": "“Heavenly Demon-nim and the Murim Lord are masters. You are so well-versed in the martial arts that  it would be shameful to compare you with me.”  I quietly looked away.  "}
{"text": "The Murim Lord was asleep by the hot spring.  “But no matter how strong you are, your life energy is not infinite.”  “What are you talking about?”  "}
{"text": "“When will your chi run out?”  Stop.  "}
{"text": "“You are blocking your spinal cord with your life energy. Your heart rate, breathing, and limb  movements are all controlled with your life energy as well.”  "}
{"text": "It was like using a chi sword all day, every day.  I shook my head.  “No matter how much life energy you have, you cannot continue this outrageous thing forever.”  "}
{"text": "“T’ll ask again. When will your chi run out, Heavenly Demon-nim?”  That woman had said a while ago.  | Humans all die someday. |  Something resonated in those words. It was the sound of realization.  There is only one way humans can realize something.  "}
{"text": "They had to experience it themselves.  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon groaned.  “Really, this child is quick to notice.”  “You don’t have many days left, right?”  Dalit ate I’ll revise my words a little. This child is dirtily quick to notice.”  "}
{"text": "This world.  How does [The Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon] get destroyed?  "}
{"text": "If you think about it, it was a surprisingly simple matter.  “If your life energy falls, it becomes impossible for you two to move your bodies.”  “Correct.”  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon looked up at the sky.  From the hole in the ceiling of the cave, a blizzard poured out of the sky as if it was raging.  "}
{"text": "“First, the tip of the toe and the fingertips will be destroyed. Then, the calves and wrists. Knees.  Shoulders. Waist. One after the other, the life energy will not be able to sustain them, and the body that  did not yield to the illness will finally rot.”  "}
{"text": "Literally, it was necrosis.  It was like a building that stopped operating one after another when fuel ran out.  At some point, the two would become immobile.  "}
{"text": "“Heart. Lungs.”  The woman touched the chest area of her shabby uniform.  “The upper body.”  "}
{"text": "Then, she tapped her head.  “All parts will rot, leaving only three parts. No. It’s all right if the other parts rot.”  "}
{"text": "“_.. You already know.”  “The Shaolin monk endured a year altogether.”  The Heavenly Demon smiled bitterly.  "}
{"text": "“He went into hiding, ashamed that others might see him and think him unworthy as a monk. At the last  minute, um. Except for his face, it wasn’t much different from the Jiangshi. The whole body was  rotting black... He couldn’t even recite the Amitabha.”  "}
{"text": "“You asked if I was afraid. That’s right. I’m afraid.”  The human voice is often compared to that of a bird.  "}
{"text": "But I bet the Heavenly Demon’s voice could not be imitated by any beast.  “T am afraid.”  A quiet murmur like the sound of a falling flower petal.  "}
{"text": "“T am afraid that my chi is exhausted. I am afraid that even my persistence will run out. I am afraid of  the blizzard. I am afraid that the sunlight will not come out, and when the day is bright, I am afraid that  my subordinates, those that used to be my subordinates, will disappear. Each time I breathe, I worry  "}
{"text": "about how many more breaths I can breathe. Every time my heart beats, I’m worried if I’ll be able to  feel the beating of my heart just a few more times in the future.”  The Heavenly Demon sighed.  "}
{"text": "“T’m afraid that I cannot kill the old man. I’m afraid that the old man will not be able to kill me. I am  afraid that the day will come when the old man and I will not be able to lie on the bed together. Lying  on the bed, I’m afraid that I’m just waiting for my life energy to run out.”  "}
{"text": "A meaningless death.  "}
{"text": "Even if they struggled to the end, it was meaningless. They would die. In the dead, disappearing world,  only snow falls and falls, leaving only achromatic landscape paintings.  “Ah.”  "}
{"text": "This is the end that [The Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon] will meet.  It was the ending of this world.  “This is why the world is so scared.”  "}
{"text": "Another day passed.  It was the eighth day after falling in the Apocalypse.  "}
{"text": "There were two days left until the world would be destroyed.  “Madu,” the Murim Lord muttered, lying on the bed. “I can’t move my body anymore.”  "}
{"text": "The Murim Lord was smiling.  And he was crying.  “Tm sorry.”  "}
{"text": "A low noise.  That was the sound of a world’s downfall.  "}

{"text": "33  “I’m sorry,” the Alchemist said. “I can’t cure him in his current state.”  She was examining the Murim Lord. Throughout the examination, the Alchemist had a dim expression.  "}
{"text": "She was like a doctor who already knew that the patient had no hope, but had to do an examination just  to confirm it to the patient.  The Heavenly Demon silently looked down at the Murim Lord.  "}
{"text": "They hadn’t been expecting treatment anyway.  Then, with an expressionless face, the Heavenly Demon opened her lips.  “Stand up.”  "}
{"text": "“Tm sorry.”  “I’m not trying to hear your apology. Stand up. Murim Lord, Ax Saint.”  The cave was dark.  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon’s breaths became quieter.  There seemed to be a poisonous fragrance flowing from her mouth.  "}
{"text": "“Did you not make an agreement with the great me? Didn’t you boast that you’d challenge the  Demonic Cult with your Righteous Sect? Didn’t you try to fight by bringing together the Nine Great  Schools and the Five Noble Clans? You can’t just die in bed. You aren’t allowed.”  "}
{"text": "“Tm sorry.”  “Stand up.”  The smell of poison became a little thicker.  "}
{"text": "“Stand up and grab your weapon. You don’t even need to hold your tasteless ax. Use a wooden sword.  Anything is fine. Use a spear, a whip, or even a wooden stick. Hold it. Grasp it and fight against the  great me.”  "}
{"text": "“Tm sorry.”  “T told you to stand up.”  “Demon lord.”  "}
{"text": "The Murim Lord breathed.  He had aged so much in just one night.  "}
{"text": "“T’m sorry I’m weaker than you.”  “T tried to hold on for one more day, but now, it is difficult. You must have felt it too. That I was already  running out of my innate energy. My chi has run out. I’m also tired. If it’s you, you might still last  "}
{"text": "another year... But this is it for me.”  There was silence.  "}
{"text": "“T was weaker than you,” the old man muttered while lying down.  “Kill me.”  The Heavenly Demon’s face distorted.  "}
{"text": "“T don’t want to be like the Shaolin head monk. Kill me before my body rots and decomposes. When  you become a Jiangshi, even if you see, you don’t see, and even if you live, you aren’t alive. So...”  "}
{"text": "“So, you want me to kill your bedridden self?”  The poison gas had reached its peak.  “Ts that what you’re talking about now?”  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon’s body was small. From that small body, a black fire blazed. The chi took shape  and burned fiercely.  Killing intent.  "}
{"text": "Her energy smelled of soot as it flared. It was an odor that told of the life she had lived and endured.  The scent of the Heavenly Demon was potent, like crushed weeds.  "}
{"text": "“Ts this the ending of the war you promised? This?”  “We ought to have taken each other down before. For what glory have we endured this so far? We  "}
{"text": "should have ordered all the followers of the sect and the cult to die together. For what bright future did  we act so stubbornly?”  The Murim Lord could not answer. The traces of the tears that the old man shed hardened on his cheek.  "}

{"text": "“But you won’t be able to die a good death.”  She headed somewhere. Even after the woman left, the burnt smell of the soot remained. It was enough  to choke someone. The Alchemist and the Medicine King, who had no skill in Aura, had particularly  "}

{"text": "“So Baek-hyang...”  “Speak.”  "}

{"text": "“Speak.”  “Why can’t you say it?!”  "}
{"text": "The old man’s lips moved slightly. His mouth opened and he parted his teeth. But he couldn’t go  beyond that. His next words did not come out. The old man seemed to have lost his tongue. He opened  and closed his mouth many times, but each time, he couldn’t form the words.  "}
{"text": "“T can’t do it,” the old man coughed out. “I can’t... I can’t say...”  Tears shed again over the trail marks of the tears that fell before. On the wrinkles, his tear marks were  "}

{"text": "“I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Baek-hyang...”  The Heavenly Demon swung the ax.  The ax blade did not cut the neck of the Murim Lord.  "}
{"text": "It just swung and pierced the ground.  The ax was stamped right next to the face of the Murim Lord. The hard rock of the cave floor cracked  easily like tofu. It was difficult for me to guess how much energy the Heavenly Demon, who found it  "}

{"text": "“Tt’s all irrelevant, anyway. Even if you die now, you do not truly die. What is the difference between a  life that is not life and a death that is not death? My great self cannot tell the difference. There’s no  point. It’s meaningless...”  "}
{"text": "She turned around.  “The whole world has become empty.”  "}
{"text": "The next day.  Namgung Un, the Murim Lord, died at dawn.  "}

{"text": "-Guuuhhh.  As the chains crashed, they made an abrasive noise. We turned our heads at the same time. The corpse  "}

{"text": "For a while, we silently looked at the Murim Lord—no, we looked at what had once been the Murim  Lord.  "}
{"text": "It kept struggling against the chains with its mouth open.  It was then that the Heavenly Demon walked over.  Tunk. Tunk.  "}
{"text": "The woman approached with a quiet, tottering walk. The woman in black. The Heavenly Demon, who  had black hair, black robes, and black eyes, was holding a black sword. Her sword was darker than her  shadow.  "}
{"text": "“—Pathetic.”  The Heavenly Demon looked down at the corpse of the Murim Lord.  “Decades spent in vain, completely futile.”  "}
{"text": "We instinctively stepped away from the Heavenly Demon.  Her poisonous power was so intense that it was incomparable to yesterday.  "}
{"text": "Her chi rose and covered her entire body.  “In the end, this is what all humans are like underneath. There’s no difference between one and a beast.  Eat, eat, eat until the body can’t move, only to disappear before long. War has forgotten chivalry, and  "}
{"text": "chivalry has forgotten war.”  The Heavenly Demon stretched out her left hand.  “Fat.”  "}
{"text": "The zombie opened its mouth and bit the hand.  Slosh!  Blood splattered.  "}
{"text": "Her flesh was torn and her bones were crushed. The Heavenly Demon nonchalantly glanced down at  the figure of the Murim Lord biting her left hand like a dog.  "}
{"text": "“H, hey.”  The Venomous Snake took a step closer.  "}
{"text": "“Look here. W, what are you doing now? What if you end up becoming a Jiangshi...?!”  “Don’t go any closer.”  I grabbed the Venomous Snake’s shoulder and stopped him.  "}
{"text": "“Huh?”  “Tt’s already over.”  “Tt’s over? What...”  "}
{"text": "The sound of flesh bursting echoed through the cave.  Puk!  "}
{"text": "All the members of the party shivered at the excessively vicious sound.  Slowly looking over, we could see that the Heavenly Demon’s left hand was in tatters.  And there was also the Murim Lord, who had lost his senses.  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon blasted her chi inside the mouth of the Murim Lord and smashed his head.  “Huff.”  In the midst of it all, we were all speechless.  "}
{"text": "“Huff, haha... Ahaha.”  The Heavenly Demon opened her mouth and laughed.  “Ahahaha! Hah! Ha, ahahahaha!”  "}
{"text": "She was truly howling with laughter.  "}
{"text": "The snowstorm continued to rage from the ceiling of the cave. However, the sound of the Heavenly  Demon’s laughter drowned out the noise of the blizzard until it was a trifling thing. Laughter filled the  cave, pealed in the sky, and swallowed the world.  "}
{"text": "-Zombie. Be careful.  Bae Hu-ryeong spoke in a low tone.  -She’s in disharmony.  "}
{"text": "At that moment.  The Heavenly Demon tumed her head and looked at us gently. Softly, alluringly, the woman smiled. A  strange voice flowed from her open lips.  "}
{"text": "“Hoho.”  The hair on the nape of my neck stood on edge.  "}
{"text": "“Are you from the righteous path, coming to assassinate my great self?”  Already, her eyes were not focused on us.  “How delightful. Come on. Let us match our swords.”  "}
{"text": "“Everyone run away!”  At the same moment as my shout, the Heavenly Demon swung her sword.  Chwaaaak!  "}
{"text": "A fountain of blood spewed out. It was the blood of the Medicine King. Cut at his neck, the Medicine  King couldn’t even scream as he collapsed, knees twisting.  "}
{"text": "It was an instant death  Seeing his colleague die in front of his nose, the Venomous Snake belatedly pulled his sword.  “This, fuck...!?”  "}
{"text": "He couldn’t read the pattern of the sword with his eyes. More than that, he couldn’t even see its motion.  He only knew that at the moment the Heavenly Demon swung her sword, the Medicine King’s throat  was sliced through. There wasn’t even a moment’s gap.  "}
{"text": "-She’s gone mad.  Bae Hu-ryeong moaned.  "}
{"text": "-Not even exorcism will work on her now. It’s because she exhausted all her energy and will, but...  Now, even if it’s temporary, she has entered into a state of life or death. Even if I was to fight her in my  prime, I would lose 4 out of 10 times.  "}
{"text": "That was the Heavenly Demon.  This was her ability before she was bitten by the Jiangshi and weakened.  "}
{"text": "She was the first person who reigned over this world.  “This is absurd.”  The Heavenly Demon hummed to herself.  "}

{"text": "The Venomous Snake raised his sword and rushed in.  “Death King! Take the Alchemist and run away!”  Even without him saying it, I was already doing so.  "}
{"text": "I grabbed the Alchemist and ran. It would be impossible to escape, but nonetheless, we fled. We did  this to struggle until the very end. In order not to take this ending and this death for granted.  “You shall not get away, lackeys of the righteous path!”  "}

{"text": "‘Okay. Then, let’s quickly choose a skill first.’  -Mhm.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong moved in the air. He then looked at the back of the cards and read them out loud. The  Heavenly Demon had quite a lot of skills, but there was one that caught our attention.  "}
{"text": "+  [Infernal Heavens Demonic Art (J K##24)]  Rank: A+  "}
{"text": "Effect: The Demonic Cult. They hate the logic of the heavens. They curse it. And they did not stop at  hating and cursing the heavens, but formed cults, eventually uniting under one doctrine. The Infernal  Heavens Demonic Art is a martial art with the essence of that doctrine.  "}

{"text": "Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.  It was a terrible name, but I couldn’t make fun of it.  rere This must be the martial arts we saw earlier, right?’  "}
{"text": "Because it was really that powerful.  She just swung her sword from a distance, but the Medicine King’s head fell off. The Venomous Snake  "}
{"text": "died without being able to withstand 3 strikes. Even I, who was confident in my training against [The  Devil King of Fall Rain], could not outrun the sword path cut by the Heavenly Demon.  The greatest skill that existed in this world.  "}
{"text": "-Tsk. It’s a typical demonic art.  Bae Hu-ryeong frowned.  "}
{"text": "-In the end, it’s a matter of how you deal with the world, whether it’s with strength or strategy.  ‘How I deal with the world?’  -Indeed. If you try to embrace the world with generosity, you usually end up in the Righteous Sect. If  "}
{"text": "you try to ravage the world, that is the Demonic Cult. That is why the people of the Righteous Sect  made their bodies into [vessels to accept the world], and the Demonic Cult’s people made their bodies  with [nails that can scratch the world]...  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong hmphed and crossed his arms.  -I’Il give you the simplest example. A sword strike that cuts straight from the head to the bottom. In  some schools, they call that the Tiger Fury because it is like [a tiger rushing].  "}
{"text": "Hwik!  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong took a stance and swung his arms down as if he was wielding a sword with both hands.  It was only for an instant, but I flinched. I really felt the spirit of a wild beast charging at me.  It was strong.  "}
{"text": "His tone and behavior are so pathetic that I sometimes forget about it, but in front of my eyes was  indeed the Sword Emperor Bae Hu-ryeong. He was a warrior who had nearly conquered the Tower  with just a sword.  "}
{"text": "-Well, it doesn’t really matter whether it’s a tiger or a bull. The specifics can vary depending on how  the founder or the creator of the move gained enlightenment. Anyway, it’s important to [imitate] a tiger  or bull.  "}
{"text": "Emulate it. Copy it.  Thus, you make something of the world into your own.  That’s what Bae Hu-ryeong meant by vessels to [accept the world. ]  "}
{"text": "-But the demonic arts are different.  Bae Hu-ryeong took a stance again.  "}
{"text": "It was the same posture as when he previously swung his arms.  -In the Demonic Sect, they say something like this when teaching initiates.  Bae Hu-ryeong breathed in forcefully and stomped his foot.  "}
{"text": "-Recall your rage, the soreness in your stomach, at the moment a thief stole one of yours.  The empty air in the void split open.  I unintentionally stepped back.  "}
{"text": "The face.  It was because of Bae Hu-ryeong’s countenance.  His face was blank, but it still emanated an infinitely cold anger.  "}
{"text": "It was as if he became a completely different person.  -Recall the moment your younger sister was dragged away by the governor. Remember your weakness,  "}
{"text": "your inability to do anything. You waited in front of the governor’s house for the night to pass, but at  dawn, your sister returned to you as a cold carcass. Remember her face, and paint it into your heart.  Bae Hu-ryeong began to perform a sword dance.  "}
{"text": "Even though his hands were empty, somehow I felt as if I could still see a sword. That sword was as  black as the space in which we stood.  "}
{"text": "-Recall when you buried your sister’s body, alone. Was it winter? The ground was frozen and it was  hard to dig. Did you dig at the stubborn soil with your fingertips? Did your fingernails crack? Did  blood flow from your broken nails?  "}
{"text": "-In the end, you couldn’t even dig down to a foot. Did you put your sister’s corpse into a pit? Did you  bury her feet first? Did you put a pile of cold dirt over your younger sister’s body? You couldn’t bury  her in the ground. In the end, did you sprinkle the dirt on her face, one handful at a time?  "}
{"text": "I couldn’t breathe.  As Bae Hu-ryeong’s sword dance continued, the endless space which we were in seemed to narrow. It  "}
{"text": "was enough to make my head spin a little. It was only the movement of his hands and arms, but Bae  Hu-ryeong’s grudge resonated deeply.  -Recall the texture of that grain of soil. Hold your sword with the hand that dug the earth. Swing your  "}
{"text": "sword as you scattered the dirt over your younger sister. Lament your helplessness and blame the  cruelty of the world.  I muttered, though it was more like a moan.  "}
{"text": "‘The nails that scratch the world...’  -That’s right.  Bae Hu-ryeong stopped his arms.  "}
{"text": "Only then could I breathe again.  -Shall we say that it’s a mental cultivation method that uses internal energy? It’s literally a way to build  "}
{"text": "and train your mind by pushing through adversity. Whether it’s a strong person or a hunter, the  outcome will be different depending on how well they use internal energy or Aura.  Bae Hu-ryeong shrugged as if it didn’t matter.  "}
{"text": "-In simpler terms, it’s a battle of wills. The demonic arts are a little heavy on the spirit.  -Anyway, Zombie, this isn’t something you need to learn.  I quietly looked at the silver skill card.  "}
{"text": "-Really, you don’t need to learn other martial arts. Don’t you know who I am? Am I not the Sword  Emperor? I’m the greatest martial artist in this universe.

{"text": "to my martial arts, it’s like trash...  ‘T want to learn it.’  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong blinked.  ‘I’m going to learn it. This. Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.’  "}
{"text": "-Uh, uh... Uuuhhh...  Blink. Blink.  "}
{"text": "It was after about 3 seconds that Bae Hu-ryeong recovered his voice.  -Why?!  “Because I want to.’  "}
{"text": "-Compared to my martial arts, this is total crap!  Bae Hu-ryeong began to go wild.  "}
{"text": "-No way. Zombie, did you fall for the Heavenly Demon’s swordplay?! The fuck. I’m gonna go nuts.  That only looked impressive because she entered the state of life or death, leaking her energy! It sucks.  It literally sucks out your energy! Zombie. A traditional warrior should not get drunk and waste one’s  energy!  "}
{"text": "I grinned.  ‘Are you mad because I’m trying to learn someone else’s martial arts?’  -Whaaat?  "}
{"text": "‘No need to worry. In any case, our Sword Emperor’s martial arts are the strongest in the universe. Do  you think I’m trying to learn the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art because I don’t know that?’  "}
{"text": "-Um...  Bae Hu-ryeong’s nose twitched.  Still, his pride seemed to have been satisfied since I flattered him a bit. This ghost was really easy to  "}
{"text": "handle.  -Well. I am, as you say, the strongest. ...But then, why are you trying to learn the demonic arts?  ‘It’s so I can fully conquer this stage.’  "}
{"text": "In other words, it was to bring the correct ending to this world.  ‘Say that a cure is made. If so, it’s over after we save two people, the Heavenly Demon and the Murim  Lord. All other humans have been dead for over two years... And treatment doesn’t mean that they’1l  "}
{"text": "survive. Isn’t that right?’  -Hmm.  Bae Hu-ryeong furrowed his brows.  "}
{"text": "-You’re right about that.  ‘Then how will the ending turn out? In the reborn new world, the Murim Lord and the Heavenly  Demon become [Adam and Eve]? Sword Emperor. Does that look like a good ending to you?’  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong’s face looked like he was chewing shit.  He was probably imagining the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord as a couple.  "}
{"text": "-No, that’s kind of... That’s really wrong. I can’t imagine a scene where the two become a sweet couple.  It gives off a bad mood...  "}
{"text": "‘Right?’  I looked straight ahead.  [Please select a skill card. ]  Whoosh! Whooooosh!  "}
{"text": "The cards chaotically danced about in the air. But I only had one card in my sight. My gaze did not  leave the silver card.  "}
{"text": "‘Creating a cure is just the first condition necessary to make a [good ending]. In the end, a great ending  depends on whether the characters in the work can really be satisfied...’  "}
{"text": "I stretched out my arm and grabbed the card.  ‘I want to present a perfectly satisfying ending to the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord.’  [Selection complete. ]  "}
{"text": "[The skill is being copied. ]  Of course, it didn’t end there.  [Your current hunter class is D Class. ]  "}
{"text": "[There is a penalty from your skill. ]  The Heavenly Demon’s trauma.  "}
{"text": "The bitter grudge in her heart.  Another hell that I had to cross.  [The trauma of the enemy who killed you is being reenacted. ]  "}

{"text": "Will I have the chance to talk calmly about the hellish landscape that I’ll cross?  3.  After returning to a day earlier.  "}
{"text": "I committed eight more suicides.  "}
{"text": "It was to return to the ‘first day’ we fell into the Apocalypse.  “—Tt’s cold!”  Same as the last time, the Venomous Snake shouted in surprise. The Alchemist and the Medicine King  "}
{"text": "also instinctively hugged themselves. The dreadful coldness overtook our party.  Guuoooh!  The blizzard raged, shouting its ire. Achoo! The Alchemist already started sneezing and coughing.  "}
{"text": "“W, why is it so cold? Wasn’t this a martial arts novel?”  “Brir. It’s like the Siberian wilderness...”  It was a white field of snow.  For me, I had become used to the sight over the past ten days.  However, the rest of the party was flustered, and I wordlessly grabbed the Alchemist’s hand.  "}
{"text": "“Ah.”  The Alchemist carefully bowed her head.  “Th, thank you. Death King-nim.”  Some memories from not too long ago struck my mind.  [I still believe in you. |  "}
{"text": "The torso of the Alchemist that had dropped onto the snow. The red-stained snowfield. All of these  images emerged one after another. My heart was pounding a bit.  "}
{"text": "I spoke calmly, however, not letting any sign of my nervousness appear on my facet.  “Tt’s natural, I guess. Chen Mu-mun master, please take care of the Medicine King.”  “All right!”  "}
{"text": "“Also, I think I just saw a human shadow over there.”  Unlike the last run-through, I led the party this time. Soon, the snowstorm died down, and before us,  the forest of silhouettes—no, the forest of corpses—stretched out.  "}
{"text": "The Venomous Snake was confused.  “ ,.What. What are these? Why are all the humans frozen?”  "}
{"text": "“Tt seems like they’re zombies.”  I touched the face of one of the corpses.  “Huh? Zombie?”  "}
{"text": "“Yes. Look at this.”  "}
{"text": "I pointed to the mouth of the zombie. Specifically, I pointed to its teeth.  “There’s a lot of flesh scraps in between the teeth. People here may not have the habit of brushing their  teeth after eating, but even then, this is a bit severe. It’s like he bit things like a beast...”  "}
{"text": "Upon hearing my words, the Alchemist’s expression changed.  She examined the corpse’s mouth with a more serious look. After a while, she seemed surprised.  "}
{"text": "“ ..He’s right. The flesh and DNA in this mouth and the owner of this body are inconsistent. They are  completely different from each other.”  "}
{"text": "“D-Doesn’t that mean he just ate human flesh?”  The Medicine King was disgusted.  “Why? People in the past also ate human flesh. It isn’t a zombie...”  "}
{"text": "“The dates of death don’t match.”  The Alchemist adjusted her glasses.  "}
{"text": "“This body died about three years ago. On the other hand, the owner of the flesh that was eaten died  two years ago. That would be impossible if the eater had died and not moved for a whole year. It’s hard  to believe, but... Yes. As Death King-nim said, it must be a zombie-like creature.”  "}
{"text": "“T, I hate monsters and horror movies! Do something about this!”  “Erm. Sir. Even if you tell me to do something about this...”  The Alchemist looked embarrassed.  "}
{"text": "‘Okay.’  The progress was much quicker than last time.  "}
{"text": "Even if the zombies started to move, we wouldn’t be caught off guard like before. The anticipation of a  situation alone can change people’s reactions completely.  Above all.  "}
{"text": "“Mm.”  In my head, I remembered the results of the last few days of research.  "}
{"text": "“Boss. Medicine King.”  “Yes?”  “Hmm?”  "}
{"text": "“T have a strange skill, though I can’t tell you what the skill is. According to my skill’s analysis..”  I explained the results of their research step by step.  "}
{"text": "My memory wasn’t perfect. I couldn’t memorize the entire file at once. However, when the Heavenly  Demon killed me and I went back 24 hours, I had more time to memorize the file carefully.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryung also memorized it with me.  “Hmm...”  Upon hearing my explanation, the Alchemist fell in deep thought.  "}
{"text": "“_,.That’s amazing. It’s a flawless research method. I can’t find any fault with it. It’s almost like  something I would do... But the terminology used is completely different from mine. No, it’s really  really awesome. What an amazing skill, Death King-nim...>?”  "}
{"text": "The Alchemist looked at me with admiration.  From my point of view, the Alchemist was praising herself.  "}
{"text": "Perhaps... The boss was evaluating herself as a ‘really, really awesome’ person. In this desolate world,  wasn’t that confidence the most amazing thing? Or that’s what I thought, at least.  “Hm. It’s good that our research time will be shortened,” the Medicine King said easily.  "}
{"text": "“Anyway, I want to get away from the zombies. Ugh. It would be nice if there was a place to stay  warm...”  "}
{"text": "At that moment.  “—Ahahaha!”  We heard the sound of laughter.  "}
{"text": "In the last run-through, I didn’t know who was the one laughing. But not this time. The Murim Lord.  The Namgung clan and Taesang family’s old man was the one who burst into laughter.  "}
{"text": "“The Demonic Cult ends today!”  “Ha.”  Then.  "}
{"text": "“Even a passing dog will turn over and laugh.”  The voice of the Heavenly Demon, of course, could be heard.  I held my breath and went in the direction of the voices.  "}
{"text": "Crunch.  The snowflakes were trampled under my shoes. The closer the voice got closer, the more clearly I  recalled the scene when the Heavenly Demon admitted her emotions.  "}
{"text": "[I am afraid. |  "}

{"text": "The warrior was still smiling.  She was standing up to the world in the middle of this snowy field, still smiling toughly.  She was like a single dot stamped on a white sheet of paper.  "}

{"text": "I just.  I just hoped that the lone dot would connect to a line.  “You guys are...?”  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon’s eyes widened. She looked at me as if she couldn’t believe it. It was worth it.  From her point of view, I was the first new person she had met in years.  “Uh, uhhh. Is my great self seeing things now? It looks like a living person is moving...”  "}
{"text": "“Heavenly Demon-nim.”  I arrived in front of the woman.  Then, I slowly knelt down.  "}
{"text": "The cool snow field gently sank under my weight.  “Huh?”  "}

{"text": "‘It’s cold.’  So Baek-hyang thought in the middle of a snowy field.  "}

{"text": "“T shall check with my own eyes if you are entitled to inherit the teachings of our school. It’s obvious  that you’re just all talk and no skill, anyway.”  I also got up from my seat.  "}
{"text": "“Thank you for the opportunity.”  I pulled out the Holy Sword.  "}
{"text": "Shiiing!  The sound of a sword being drawn echoed in the wide cave. People were looking in my direction. They  were quietly waiting to see the kind of swordsmanship I would demonstrate.  "}
{"text": "Of course, I had no intention of showing off the Three Calamities Swordsmanship.  [Your skill is being activated. ]  Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.  "}
{"text": "After all, there was a skill that I learned for this very moment.  “... wooo.”  "}

{"text": "I’d witnessed groans and screams while climbing the tower thus far. The moaning and the screaming  were always raw and vivid. I remembered these sounds as if I had just heard them a moment ago. Their  voices colored my heart.  "}

{"text": "I recalled the voices of children who were trapped and tortured.  [I want to live. |  "}
{"text": "The children had been bound in chains. When the mansion was caught on fire and burned, the children  stared at the flames in front of their eyes. Trapped in the chains, they could not escape. They had to  patiently wait until they were thoroughly burned.  "}
{"text": "[I wanted to play a little longer. |  With the children’s screams in my heart, I swung my sword.  “Ma, Madu! That swordsmanship...”  "}
{"text": "Nearby, I heard the Murim Lord exclaiming in bewilderment. But I ignored it. He wasn’t what I had to  focus on right now.  Slowly, not hurrying, step by step.  "}
{"text": "I swung my sword, thinking of what I had to think.  | Burn her! |  | Burn the witch’s nest! |  I remembered Preta’s voice as she tried to save the sick at the edge of a continent.  | Why? |  "}
{"text": "| You are all humans. |  Preta had shed black tears from her eyes. The paradise she made. The small village was burning. The  sight of aman burning another man was engraved in Preta’s eyes.  "}
{"text": "| You know about the beauty and tears of life, so why?! Just why?! |  | You called us monsters. That’s why you didn’t hesitate to burn us! |  | Are we not also human?! |  "}
{"text": "With Preta’s screams in my heart, I swung my sword.  "}
{"text": "My sword moved faster and faster. The Infernal Heavens Demonic Art that I gained from my death  took shape. The trauma that had been transplanted after I died pulsed with anticipation. I felt like I  would get lost in the middle of this, but then, I called forth my Aura and forced myself to continue the  sword forms.  "}
{"text": "-Look at this kid...?  Bae Hu-ryeong said that the demonic arts were nails that scratched the world.  However, as I practiced the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art, my mind changed a little.  "}
{"text": "Perhaps it is more of a scream than a nail.  -Wow.  "}
{"text": "The path of my sword continued and continued, then finally became a sword dance.  -Now I see that if you were born in the Murim world, you’d have entered the Demonic Cult.  "}
{"text": "In the end, my sword dance was not beautiful. It was immature. It was clumsy. There was no scent of  flowers, only the smell of fire. If swordsmanship had a face, my sword was the face of a person with a  burn scar.  "}
{"text": "It was only a scream.  No matter how admirable yin and yang were, the world born from them was only full of grief.  "}
{"text": "No matter how clever the script of the Three Character Classics was, it could not overcome a single  scream of a lowly human.  The sword containing the grief of the world was sharper than the sword of yin and yang.  "}
{"text": "A sword that wielded a single scream was stronger than a sword that moved according to a wise saying.  The deeper the grief, the coarser the scream, the stronger the sword.  That was why we were strong.  Survival of the fittest.  That was the doctrine of the Demonic Sect.  "}
{"text": "| Speak. |  | War has forgotten chivalry, and chivalry has forgotten war. Say it. |  [If you say this, I will kill you as you want. |  The Heavenly Demon was the epitome of this doctrine.  The highest sky.  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon knew of all the screams of her sect members and knew how to release them all  with a sword. The sword form that the Heavenly Demon used must be a scream that faced the world,  move by move.  "}
{"text": "It was proof that somewhere in this world, there were those who had screamed and yelled in agony.  | The whole world has become empty. |  | Decades spent in vain, completely futile. |  "}
{"text": "She was that sort of sky.  Even the Heavenly Demon screamed in the final moment.  | Ahaha. Ha, hahaha! |  She laughed madly.  | Ahahahaha! Ha, ahahaha... |  "}
{"text": "With that laughter in my heart, I swung my sword.  "}
{"text": "“Stop.”  I swung my sword.  “Stop it.”  "}
{"text": "I swung my sword.  “Did I not tell you to stop?!”  Suddenly, my sword stopped.  "}
{"text": "I didn’t stop because I wanted to stop. There was a cane. The Heavenly Demon lifted a wooden stick  and stopped my blade. Her dark inner energy echoed on the cane.  "}
{"text": "“You...” the Heavenly Demon muttered in a low voice.  “Where did you learn the skills of our school?”  Her eyes were pitch black.  "}
{"text": "“You can’t fool my eyes! No matter how messed up and inexperienced your forms are, what you’ve  done right now was definitely the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.

{"text": "So Baek-hyang parted her lips.  -How did you guys get here?  "}

{"text": "-Are you okay now?  Put toads, vipers, tarantulas, centipedes, fire ants, wasps, and all kinds of poisonous insects into the jar.  Then, seal the lid. The viper bites the toad, the toad eats the tarantula, and the venom eats each other  "}

{"text": "It wasn’t something that could be warmed with a warm morning’s porridge, evening’s soup, or a thick  blanket. Ice that would never heat up was buried in the middle of her heart. That was her heart.  Her mother was leaving.  "}

{"text": "-Because they want us to take revenge for them.  -Because of regret and resentment. Because they could not forgive the governor and towns that ruined  their lives. They want to get revenge, but they don’t have the power to get revenge.  "}

{"text": "-Is that so... I suppose you do.  It was quiet.  "}
{"text": "-If so, the world will have to listen to you.  The old man opened his eyes.  -I am one of the Demonic Sect’s Seven Elders. I am known as the Demonic Buddha.  "}
{"text": "-Is there a Buddha in hell?  -If there is no Buddha in hell, what use does he have?  "}
{"text": "Even though So Baek-hyang called this place hell, the old man did not reproach her. Rather, he  responded as if it were natural.

{"text": "“Yes. I cleaned until I felt that even my mind was cleansed.”  “T hate people who speak well.”  The woman frowned, furrowing her eyebrows as if she found me dissatisfactory.  "}

{"text": "1.  What word in the world matched the least with [zombie]?  I knew that it was a strange question.  "}
{"text": "But this world was occupied by zombies. As I fought against zombies and practiced martial arts, I  naturally had to worry about zombies. So I just realized which word was the worst combo with a  zombie.  "}
{"text": "-Guuuoh!  That was [Hadouken].[1]  "}
{"text": "-Uwaaa, aaaah!  A zombie in a black robe gathered his hands and fired a Hadouken at me.  I wasn’t kidding. It was real.  "}
{"text": "I’ll say it again. This [zombie], who had lived as a person of the Murim world, screamed and fired  [Hadouken] at me.  "}
{"text": "“This is crazy—.”  Whoosh!  "}
{"text": "The Hadouken easily pushed me back. I flew through the air like a tossed wooden stick. What had  happened so far already left me dumbfounded, but it didn’t end there.  -Wooooohh!  "}
{"text": "The zombie kicked the ground with a tap. It was a strange technique for movement. He sleekly  activated a lightness skill. As if his body was filled with helium, the zombie soared into the air. In a  moment, the zombie flew all the way to right in front of my nose.  "}
{"text": "Insanity.  “Hey! Wait, this can’t be real!”  "}
{"text": "I swung the Holy Sword urgently. But before I could wildly cut the zombie, a voice stopped me from  swinging.  "}
{"text": "“Wrong! Don’t swing your sword randomly.”  It was the voice of the Heavenly Demon.  She was looking down at my fight from above the pit.  "}
{"text": "“Did I not say this? Think of the hunger, death by starvation. Think only of the gnawing in your  stomach. If you just swing your sword, the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art is nothing more then a  useless shell.”  "}
{"text": "“B, but!”  "}
{"text": "The zombie opened its mouth in front of my face. Crack! I barely managed to twist myself away and  avoid the zombie’s teeth. I didn’t have the time to fall properly, so I just ended up on rolling on the  ground. Was it more angry because I avoided it? The zombie roared and rushed at me again.  "}
{"text": "“T’m not really hungry right now!”  “Fool.”  The Heavenly Demon shouted as if she was frustrated.  "}
{"text": "“Can’t you think of the color red in your mind even if it isn’t in front of your eyes? Just because you’re  not hungry right now doesn’t mean you can’t remember the feeling of hunger.”  -Guuuoh!  "}
{"text": "While the Heavenly Demon talked to me, the zombie continued to attack me with its nails. If I was  scratched by those nails even once, it would be over for me. If I became infected with the zombie virus,  I would become Kim Zombie in the truest sense of the word.  "}
{"text": "Chaang! Clink!  "}
{"text": "The zombie’s nails struck my sword with a horrible sound. I couldn’t attack, busy as I was with trying  to defend myself. I could taste death.  “If you can’t do this, it is because you aren’t yet used to the sense of hunger. Your stomach is too full.  "}
{"text": "Those who learn the Infernal Heavens Demonic Arts must be able to freely recall their senses!”  A sense of hunger.  Memory of hunger.  "}
{"text": "“Remember the longest time you were starved for. Go over your senses from back then. Where were  you then? What did you want to eat the most? How long had you been hungry?!”  "}
{"text": "“The longest time I starved for was 3 to 4 days...”  “What? Three to four days?”  The Heavenly Demon was dumbfounded.  "}
{"text": "“... You mean that the longest you’ve ever starved was for only three days? That’s ridiculous. It has  been a long time since the world has become so turbulent, and the harvest has been bad. How could  you only starve for three days, unless you’re the child of a noble family?”  "}

{"text": "“Enough.”  The Heavenly Demon tumed around.  “This was my fault! For a moment, I had hope. As I thought, you are a man who’s only talk.”  "}
{"text": "I was at the bottom of the huge pit. So, the Heavenly Demon’s figure quickly disappeared from my  view. Chaaang! Clink! Barely blocking the zombie’s teeth and nails, I shouted at the already distant  Heavenly Demon.  "}
{"text": "“Heavenly Demon-nim!”  There was no answer.  "}
{"text": "“Heavenly Demon-nim?!”  Again, there was no answer.  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon was a warrior who didn’t look back.  “Please wait! Oh my God, it’s not like being hungry is something special! Does that make any sense  that you can’t learn martial arts because of that?! Huh?!”  "}

{"text": "“Fine. So she’s coming at me like this, huh?”  I ignored Bae Hu-ryeong’s words and left the hot spring cave.  “If you come out like that, do you think Pll cower and surrender? Am I supposed to be thankful? ’m a  "}

{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong wore a rare, embarrassed expression.  -Zombie? Why are you like this? Hey. Instead of this, learn swordsmanship only from me, not the  Heavenly Demon woman or something. I’m much more tolerant when it comes to being a teacher...  "}
{"text": "“She wants me to feel hungry? Then I’Il starve!”  -Damn it.  Bae Hu-ryeong muttered.  "}
{"text": "-What a dilemma. This guy’s completely gone nuts. Oh, he’s a crazy kid who can’t see anything in  front of him when he gets mad... We’ll lose out on so many days...  "}
{"text": "From that day on, I entered the road to hell.  ‘I’m going to find the items needed to clear this stage.’  "}
{"text": "That’s what I told the party. With that, I left.  Alone, I went as far as I could from the hot spring cave and isolated myself on a snowy mountain.  "}
{"text": "Doing nothing. I just stayed there.  -You’re crazy...  "}
{"text": "Did he even know what I was trying to do?  Bae Hu-ryeong looked at me with judgemental eyes.  -You’re just going to stay here until you starve, right?  “Yes. That’s it.”  "}
{"text": "-Ah, man.  Bae Hu-ryeong lamented.  "}
{"text": "-Everyone else should have to know how dumb this guy is. Ah, poor me! I’m the only one who knows  this, alas. I regret becoming a ghost when I died. I regret it!  "}
{"text": "He was noisy.  -Zombie. No, Gonja. Please. I don’t care that you’re so crazy immersed in your training, but what did I  do wrong that I have to keep watching you from the side? Huh?  "}
{"text": "“Hey, I told you you’re being noisy.”  -Let me ask one thing. How many days do you intend to do this?  "}
{"text": "I sat in a small cave on a snowy mountain. It was different from the cave where the Heavenly Demon  and the party stayed. Of course, there was no hot spring, and there were no grains or energy bars. It was  just a dark and cold cave.  "}
{"text": "“T don’t know. At least 112 days.”  -What?  "}
{"text": "“T saw it in the Heavenly Demon’s trauma. She hadn’t eaten anything for 111 days and endured with  just air. So ll hold on for 112 days.”  -You damn sashimi-like...  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryreong continued to curse at me for over a minute. But it was pointless. No matter what he  cursed at me, my mind was unaffected. I had already started to sit in a lotus position.  "}
{"text": "-You can’t last for more than 100 days, no matter how much you want to!  Bae Hu-ryeong cried out.  "}
{"text": "-Look at the weather now. It’s cold! It’s super cold! You’d freeze right away if you didn’t have Aura,  but how are you going to keep circulating your aura for over 100 days? No matter how much you try,  20 days will be the limit.  "}
{"text": "Seeing how I didn’t respond to abusive language, he was now trying to speak persuasively.  -Besides, Gongja. Enduring for more than 100 days is no longer in the realm of hunger. You’ve never  starved for more than 100 days, right? Since you haven’t, stop talking.  "}
{"text": "“Have you ever starved like that?”  "}
{"text": "-Yup. I know it because I practiced fasting in my youth. I felt like I was going to die of hunger for a  few days, but after a while, I didn’t even feel hungry! It’s not starvation, it’s just mental discipline.  Mental discipline!  "}
{"text": "“Then there’s my answer,” I replied flatly.  “T just need to fast for 15 days, then keep repeating the 15th day.”  Bae Hu-ryeong huffed.  "}
{"text": "-What are you saying?  “T won’t eat anything for 15 days. I’ll hold on until my hunger peaks. Then I’ II kill myself to stay on  the 15th day. My hunger level won’t change.”  "}
{"text": "I looked at Bae Hu-ryeong.  "}
{"text": "“T repeat until I have 112 days like that. How does it sound? I won’t run out of Aura. I’ll continue to  feel hunger. It’s the perfect solution.”  -You... Madman...  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong was astonished.  -Just learn from me... Don’t take a strange master as your teacher. I told you, my martial arts is  superior. If you really need a teacher, you can learn from me. What the hell is making you do such a  "}

{"text": "Even if people continued to talk, none of their words mattered. Even if people moved, no matter where  they went, no matter what they felt, none of it had any meaning.

{"text": "It had been a week since I started fasting.  “Well.”  The first and second days were the most painful. After three days passed, the pain went away. My gut  "}
{"text": "movements slowed down. My thoughts became slow. My life itself faded a little.  If you compare a person’s life to a river, in my case one could say that the current had shrunk and dried  up like a river during a year of famine.  "}

{"text": "It quietly faded and receded. The stream of water shrunk and shrunk again, and it persisted like that  until one day, the stream of pain, the stream of thoughts, and the stream of life all dried up.  Was this what [hunger] was?  "}
{"text": "Did the Heavenly Demon want me to train like this?  "}
{"text": "I got up from my cross-legged position.  “This isn’t what she meant,” I muttered quietly. “If I just stay still, this will all be for nothing.”  I took out my sword. In my head, I pictured the movements of the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art, and I  "}
{"text": "swung the sword according to that image. Thoughtlessly.  -What are you doing?  “Exercise.”  "}
{"text": "Winter was cold. I inhaled and exhaled the cold air. Was it because I drank snow for the past 7 days?  My breath seemed to resemble a flurry of snow.  "}
{"text": "“T was thinking about this wrong. I’m a little stupid... The [hunger] that the Heavenly Demon  mentioned is not simply [not eating]. It’s even worse to just fast in the lotus position.”  "}
{"text": "It was the first time I moved my body in a week, and I immediately ran out of breath.  My muscles were shaking. My respiratory tract was tight.  “Hunger is when [you want to eat but cannot eat].  "}
{"text": "Clumsily, I tried to do a sword dance.  "}
{"text": "However, I was sweating. It was different from sitting silently. My body began to come alive. The  amount of sweat dripping from my skin was probably equal to the amount of water I took in.  “This week, I was thinking about a farmer. A hungry farmer.”  "}
{"text": "What is hunger?  “What sort of farmer wouldn’t go out to the field because he was hungry? Whether he’s hungry or not,  whether he ate or not, he has to work. And even if he works hard, there’s nothing to eat.”  "}
{"text": "Wasn’t that what hunger was?  "}
{"text": "“He swings his pickax. He digs the ground. But it’s a famine. It’s been a grim time. No matter how  much he works, the seeds don’t sprout. The seeds really won’t grow.”  I swung my sword.  "}
{"text": "“Because there is nothing he can do—”  I closed my eyes.  The land.  "}
{"text": "I imagined a land that was dry and arid.  “—that’s why he is hungry.”  "}
{"text": "A farmer strikes the dry ground with a pickax. Thud! The dirt would crumble. Like breaking a stale  cookie.  “Tt’s been over half a year since it rained.”  "}
{"text": "The reservoir is empty. The well in the village is also dry. There isn’t a single drop of water in the field.  In broad daylight, an old man comes out and sits at the entrance of the village. He doesn’t speak. The  old man’s wrinkled face is also dry.  "}
{"text": "“Because it’s a drought.”  The sun is hot.  "}
{"text": "Some villagers have already abandoned their farming work. Their fields were abandoned. Since they  abandoned their work, there were fewer reasons for them to not abandon their homes. The villager took  the children and left for the coast.  "}
{"text": "“But this farmer hasn’t let go yet.”  -Why?  "}
{"text": "“Because the sea doesn’t seem to be different. He doesn’t know how to fish. People can only live by  what they learn to steal, and the farmer only knows to steal from the earth. It was the same for his  father, his father’s father, and the father before that...”  "}
{"text": "One day passed.  Two days.  Three.  "}
{"text": "The farmer goes out to the field. He goes to work even though there is no reward. In the evening, he  climbs the mountain and peels off the bark of some surviving trees that he can eat.  “Now, there is hardly any bark left.”  "}
{"text": "All the villagers had taken off.  When he descended from the mountain and looked back, the trees were all white and bare. From a  distance, it looked like a forest of birch trees.  "}
{"text": "Hunger was what made the world white.  “But.”  "}
{"text": "The farmer swung his pickax on the bare ground.  I swung my sword in the air.  "}
{"text": "“He can’t even eat the bark.”  He has a family.  “Tt’s been more than a week since he’s eaten anything resembling food.”  "}
{"text": "He has a child.  -So?  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong asked. The pickax swung repeatedly, as did my sword.  -So what are you going to do?  “First, he’ll go to the well in the village.”  "}
{"text": "He barely scoops a bowl of water from the well, which you could see the floor of.  “The water is used to prepare the bark. Put small leaves in the water... And then boil it.”  The fresh smell of plants.  "}
{"text": "The thick smell of the bark mixed with the water vapor and spread through the air.  The farmer swallows his drool.  I’m hungry.’  "}
{"text": "I also gulped.  *T want to eat.’  "}
{"text": "He wants to bite off the bark.  The bark was becoming sweeter. The bark retained the smell of the water and leaves. He thought it  would be sweet. He wanted to tear the bark apart with his teeth. The thick juices would probably flow  "}
{"text": "from where it was torn. There would be an earthy taste to it. A brown colored food.  The bark was edible soil.  "}
{"text": "*T want to eat.’  But he had to be patient.  ’I have to give it to my children... At least this. I have to give it to them.’  "}
{"text": "The children whined. They cried.  The bark that their father brought. The children hated the bark that he brought and barely touched it.  They screamed. They complained while eating.  "}
{"text": "They flipped it.  ’ Ah.’  "}
{"text": "Without thinking, the farmer slapped his child on the cheek.  Just like the farmer swinging his arm, I also swung my sword.  “This isn’t me.”  "}
{"text": "The farmer turns his back on his children.  This isn’t who I am.’  "}
{"text": "... He wasn’t someone of the nature to beat his kids originally. He was not such a person. However, the  famine was terrible. It had been so long since he’d put proper food in his mouth, and his nerves were  sharp. He became sensitive. It was too much...  "}
{"text": "’*My life isn’t supposed to be like this.’  The farmer picks up the bark.  What is hunger?  There have been numerous famines since the world began.  There were countless farmers.  "}
{"text": "There was a lot of hunger.  [Fight while you are hungry. |  Can you move despite the hunger?  | All of your sword’s movements must stem from hunger. |  That was right.  "}

{"text": "-In a word, a master of the Righteous Sect is using the demonic arts. You want me to be more precise?  It’s [a master of the Righteous Sect who only knows how to use the demonic arts]. You zombie. Are  your nose and ears stuffed?  "}

{"text": "Ah. I was hungry.  I wanted to eat a Choco Pie.  "}
{"text": "A Choco Pie that when you bite into it tastes like chocolate. A Choco Pie with a chewy white  marshmallow inside. I wanted to eat just one piece of Choco Pie while drinking warm milk.  What is hunger?  "}
{"text": "Gongja says that hunger is a Choco Pie.  A delicious and healthy chocolate pie—  "}
{"text": "-... Hey. You’re thinking of something else now, aren’t you?  “No? I’m thinking about martial arts.”  -Don’t lie. I can clearly see from your face that you’re thinking something foolish.  "}
{"text": "Why does this man know me so well? Was he a stalker? Technically, Bae Hu-ryeong was a ghost that  always followed behind me. You can even say that he’s a ghost stalker. My mood soured when I  thought that.  "}
{"text": "What a nasty stalker.  "}
{"text": "“T’m telling the truth. The truthiest of truths. Were you frequently deceived when you were alive to be  this doubtful?”  -Then tell me. What and how were you thinking about martial arts?  "}
{"text": "The stalker nitpicked. Even the way that he hung onto the little things resembled the behavior of a  stalker. Even though he was as large as a gorilla. Hurry up and enter Nirvana, Ghost Gorilla Stalker.  "}
{"text": "I made a solemn expression.  “T thought I’d go down the mountain for a while.”  "}
{"text": "-Descend the mountain? Why? Are you going to teach the Heavenly Demon a lesson this time?  “Psssh.”  I waved my hand in denial.  "}
{"text": "“T’ve only just reached the start of the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art. What use is it if I commit suicide  now and return to the Heavenly Demon? I’ll only get the same reaction, like [Well, he has some  potential].  "}
{"text": "-Yeah? Why does that matter? You’lI still get recognition from her.  “How is that enough? That won’t do at all.”  I left the cave.  "}
{"text": "“Do you know how frustrated and upset I was when the Heavenly Demon ignored me, saying that I’d  never really starved? I’m a petty person. Just being recognized can’t heal my wounds.”  "}
{"text": "-This guy is giving me a bad feeling...  “The response I want is [I’m surprised].”  "}
{"text": "I wanted to see her surprised face.  I wanted the Heavenly Demon to see me use the sword and be shocked.  "}
{"text": "“(Your talent is overflowing! It’s explosive! I didn’t realize that you were an opportunity for me. ’m  sorry, the eyes of the great me have sprained for a while.]”  Yup.  "}

{"text": "“When I asked you to describe the touch of an apple, you replied that you do not know. But when I  asked you about hunger? You felt the mud. You could smell the mud. You chewed the mud and ate it!  You have seen the flowing river, and you must have overheard the sounds of the river.”  "}

{"text": "“Correct! The originally crunchy apple has already been chewed on by the spoon, and it becomes  grainy. But is that all? Has it become tasteless?”  “No. The yellow juice is filling up my mouth.”  "}
{"text": "“Yes! And is that all? If you scrape the peel, too, the remaining apple peel becomes ridiculously  wrinkled. The hand of the mother who dug the apple for you also becomes yellow from the juice of the  apple. But then, say, child. What among these feelings is the feeling of the apple?”  "}
{"text": "I was stuck in my own thoughts.  The Heavenly Demon asked me as if trying to make me hurry,  "}
{"text": "“Ts it an apple as a whole? Is it an apple cut in half? Is it the scraped juice of a spoon? Is it the peel? Is  it the mother’s hand? What is your apple?”  "}
{"text": "What is my apple?  “TI saw a mother who only ate the peel after giving all the flesh of the apple to her child.”  “To me, an apple is the leftover peels for the mother. It is a child with a cold. It is the mother’s heart  "}

{"text": "Even though we were sitting in the middle of a snowy field.  Maybe it was because the Heavenly Demon had smiled.  “—And I also think of those young children whose mothers never carved an apple for them.”  "}
{"text": "But the Heavenly Demon’s smile did not last long.  “T think of a mother who cannot buy apples. I think a mother who would not buy one even though she  has the means. I think of a child who has no one to care for him even though he is lying on his back. I  "}

{"text": "I grabbed the grip of the sword without thinking.  “As a geisha sings and a scholar recites a poem, we swing our swords. What is the difference between a  ruffian from a band of thieves and a warrior from our sect? They are swung by the sword. But we  "}

{"text": "-The specifics are slightly different for each sect. There are places where you perform a deep bow 9  times and there are places where you bow only 3 times... I don’t know how it is in the Demonic Cult.  It’s a secret and sacred ceremony.  "}
{"text": "‘How was it at your sect?’  -Well, if you endure after being hit by the teacher 9 times, that was the Ceremony of Nine Salutes for  us. I endured up to my 63rd hit, so it was the longest record in my sect’s history. Isn’t that awesome ?  "}
{"text": "I realized why Bae Hu-ryeong was such a crazy guy.  His Righteous Sect just made a bunch of madmen.  "}
{"text": "“_..Shut up. I myself will decide who to accept as disciples and when,” the Heavenly Demon said. “It’s  not a matter for you to interfere in.”  "}
{"text": "“You’re just talking vainly now. Of course I have to interfere!”  The Murim Lord came down from the Venomous Snake’s back with a thump. The old man stared at the  Heavenly Demon fiercely.  "}
{"text": "“Because the reason you don’t take in disciples is that you feel sorry for me!”  “Huuuh? What are you saying...”  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s just the two of us left. You are the only one on the path of evil, and I am the only one on the path  of righteousness. If you alone take in a disciple, the only young people will be in the Demonic Cult. So  what is the conclusion? It’s like you’re winning the war between good and evil without even fighting!”  "}
{"text": "“You and I have agreed to end this ourselves. We swore. Because you feel bad about breaking our oath  and you feel sorry for me, you’re not accepting that young child as your disciple!”  "}
{"text": "Huh.  ‘...I guess that’s right. It could also be that sort of reason.’  They’re in the same situation, but it would be weird if only one of them had a disciple.  "}
{"text": "Looking at the feelings of the Heavenly Demons, it seemed that she did feel sorry for the Murim Lord.  But.  “Tsk, tsk. There’s no need to be so uselessly loyal!”  "}
{"text": "“T thought you would do this, so I took the initiative.”  "}
{"text": "The Murim Lord tapped the Venomous Snake on the shoulder.  The Venomous Snake scratched his cheek with a bitter smile.  “Well. It ended up like this.”  The Heavenly Demon’s eyes widened.  "}
{"text": "“O, old man... You couldn’t possibly have, that kid...”  “That’s right! I made him my top disciple today!”  "}
{"text": "“You bastard, you think it’s all right to do this to my great self?!”  The Heavenly Demon rushed at him. Boom, boom! Two masters rolled around in the snow in a  dogfight.  "}
{"text": "“Do you know what kind of heart I had, not going forth with the ceremony today?! But this old man  ignored the young, devoted heart of my great self as if it was nothing...!”  "}
{"text": "“Shuddup! If fate comes to find you, thank your departed parents in heaven and accept it! A person  can’t just ignore it because they’re being too conscious of others!”  "}
{"text": "“What about the Great Battle of Good and Evil?!”  “Does it have to be just the two of us for it to be the battle? If our disciples fight, it can also be  considered as the great battle!”  "}
{"text": "“T can’t accept it unless you’re my opponent!”  “For a demon lord, you sure have some idiotic thoughts!”  "}
{"text": "“What did you say?!”  The woman grabbed the old man’s neck.  "}
{"text": "The old man, unwilling to lose, grabbed the woman’s head and glared.  “Agh, you demon! You’re always like this. If it’s not one thing, it’s the other. You rockhead! You think  the world will split apart just because we split our positions?”  "}
{"text": "“T don’t know what sort of world you see, but the landscape I see is ice! Anyway, it will split if you  split it!”  "}
{"text": "“Then melt it!”  “There is a fire called the Demonic path that will melt it! And the demonic cult members are the  "}
{"text": "firewood!”  “Then get one more log for the fire!”  "}
{"text": "“Ax saint, you...! You hypocrite of the Righteous Path, you’re just grabbing the ends of my words to  fight me...!”  "}
{"text": "There was such an argument between the old man and the woman. Whenever the two traded blows, two  different worlds clashed with each other with the sound of metal. Worlds were able to establish  themselves even in this endless dog fight.  "}
{"text": "Leaving the two worlds to fight, I looked at the Venomous Snake.  “Tt’s a little surprising.”  “What are you talking about?”  "}
{"text": "How did someone like you, with your true self, take someone as a teacher? —was not something that I  could say to him right away.  So I beat around the bush a little.  "}
{"text": "“Aren’t you the Chen Mu-mun master? Is it okay for the guildmaster to receive tutelage from a new  teacher?”  "}
{"text": "“Fuck. If you have a place to do a sword dance, you do the sword dance, and if you have a teacher to  + ie 2  "}
{"text": "learn from, you ask to learn. I can’t just sit back for each of these things, picking at ‘why’.  The Venomous Snake smiled. The thick lines of his face held a manly kind of smile.  "}
{"text": "Huh.  “Venomous Snake-nim.”  “What?”  "}
{"text": "“T’ll tell you clearly. Being pushed into this position by force or by mere pity. You’Il regret it if you  were to be a disciple of the Murim Lord with such a half-hearted resolution.”  "}
{"text": "The two worlds were still fighting loudly.  It was different from the time that the Venomous Snake was pushed into the Chronicles of the Heavenly  "}
{"text": "Demon by his pride and his followers.  This was an insult to those two worlds.  "}
{"text": "I couldn’t forgive it.  “ ..T really don’t know what you’re talking about.”  The Venomous Snake scratched his cheek, then sharply raised his single eye.  "}
{"text": "“Hey, why is the guy called the Death King rambling about this so much? If you want to confirm  something, confirm it with your sword.”  "}
{"text": "With that, the Venomous Snake raised his sword.  “Tt won’t be easy, though.”  "}
{"text": "But there was an easy way to check. It would become apparent if I opened up the Venomous Snake’s  psychological status window.  But instead of doing that, I said quietly, “Venomous Snake-nim.”  "}
{"text": "“Yeah.”  “Have you ever been hungry?”  The Venomous Snake blinked.  "}
{"text": "“What?”  At that moment, I ran forward.  "}

{"text": "5.  I rushed at him.  I raised my sword.  "}
{"text": "I stabbed and cut.  Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.  "}
{"text": "First form.  Sword of Starvation.  "}
{"text": "My body became that of a hungry farmer. My sword became a pickax. Struck by my blade, the air  crumbled like dried mud.  At the end of the smashed, shattered, and broken void was the head of the Venomous Snake.  "}
{"text": "“What...?”  The Venomous Snake flinched. His gaze was stained with shock. The Venomous Snake’s shoulder was  about to move, but it stopped, and in the next moment, his hips moved. He had given up on a  "}
{"text": "counterattack and was now trying to dodge.  But there was no way that a farmer’s pickax would not strike the land.  "}
{"text": "My sword dug into the void. The Venomous Snake pulled himself back. The void sucked in his body’s  worth of air, breaking the atmosphere.  "}
{"text": "Bang!  The snow whirled around with the sound of the air cracking and bursting. It was winter. Every time the  wind blew, the snow did too, and the air that scratched one’s nostrils was extremely dry.  "}
{"text": "“—Fuck.”  "}
{"text": "The Venomous Snake raised his sword. Between the flurries of snow, the Venomous Snake’s eye  flashed. There was a shock in the lone eye of the Chen Mu-mun master.  “What is this?”  "}
{"text": "I rushed at him.  Once again, I raised my sword.  I stabbed and cut.  "}
{"text": "“Ho—” The Venomous Snake again jumped back instead of blocking my sword. “Holy shit.” And with  an explosive bang, ice pellets rose in the air. “Fuckin—” Whenever I cut, the Venomous Snake escaped.  He had no choice but to avoid it. “Son of a gun!” A whirlwind burst in his place.  "}
{"text": "“Motherfucker!”  As [ran at him again, I stopped.  "}
{"text": "To be precise, my body came to a stop abruptly.  I wasn’t breathing. I hadn’t realized it.  "}
{"text": "“Huff.” As I inhaled, dry air hit my throat. There was a tornado raging in my lungs.  “Hooo.” I felt as if my intestines had flipped over.  “Haaah.” Every time I breathed, my body hurt and I trembled.  But I did not let go of my sword.  "}
{"text": "One round.  The battle was over in one round.  "}
{"text": "“Infection... it was obvious that you would get it...”  The Venomous Snake stared at me in a cold sweat.  "}
{"text": "“Death King, I thought you were just talking shit... But your sword skills are also quite good. Fuck.  Really, what the hell? These blows can be summed up as a [Petty Demonic Sword]!”  “Yes, disciple! That indeed is a sword where you can feel the force of the devil that freezes and shatters  "}
{"text": "the world. It is the [Eternal Demon Sword]!” cried the Murim Lord, who was grappling with the  Heavenly Demon.  There must be an insurmountable, 4th-dimensional wall that could not be crossed between the [Petty  "}
{"text": "Demonic Sword] that the Venomous Snake said and the [Eternal Demon Sword] that the Murim Lord  was talking about, but that wall could not be noticed unless one was a mind reader.[1]  The Heavenly Demon also did not realize that the wall was there. She clicked her tongue.  "}
{"text": "“You’re pretty sharp for a guy with only one eye.”  “Of course! It’s unfortunate that he’s a little old, but he has a ‘true’ eye that sees the essence of things.  Otherwise, would this Ax Saint accept him as a disciple?” the Murim Lord shouted, glancing at me.  "}
{"text": "“Hmm. You’ve also gotten a better disciple than you could have expected. It hasn’t been long since he’s  been yours, and he’s already using a terrifying demonic sword like that, haha. The Demon Lord’s little  seed is scary enough to surpass even the Four Demon Lords!”  "}
{"text": "“T told you, I still haven’t accepted him as a disciple...”  "}
{"text": "“Confound it! Are you still saying that sort of stuff?!”  The Heavenly Demon shut her mouth.  "}
{"text": "‘That’s right,’ I thought, breathing wildly. “This isn’t a fight for me to beat the Venomous Snake, nor a  fight for the Venomous Snake to beat me.’  "}
{"text": "The purpose of this match was—  “To make the Heavenly Demon accept me.’  In this respect, the Murim Lord and I had the same purpose.  "}
{"text": "We were both trying to give the Heavenly Demon, who was just waiting for destruction, a future.  The Murim Lord grinned.  “Disciple!”  "}
{"text": "“Yes, Master!”  The Murim Lord shouted at the Venomous Snake, who answered with good spirit.  "}
{"text": "“From now on, I’ll give you some advice! Make sure you listen!”  “What...?”  The Heavenly Demon’s jaw dropped.  "}
{"text": "“O, old man! What are you doing now?!”  “Why? Do you have a problem? Didn’t you say you weren’t teaching that greenhorn demon?”  "}
{"text": "“Th, that’s true, but... I mean, you’re giving advice during their competition! It’s rude for someone to  give a hand when playing baduk, but it’s even more so when two martial artists are competing!”[2]  "}
{"text": "“These two are martial artists?”  The Murim Lord laughed and stroked his beard.  “In my eyes, I can only see the proud successor of the Righteous path and the newbie Demonic cultist.  "}
{"text": "Since it’s a young demon, it’s okay no matter how we defeat him. So, there’s no problem.”  “The more I see this old man, he really...!”  “Hehe.”  "}
{"text": "The Murim Lord shouted energetically,  “Disciple! That newbie demonic cultist, his blows may be pretty hard, but don’t think he can keep up  this momentum! Never get hit and keep avoiding it. Dodge, and wait for his strength to fall!”  "}
{"text": "“Oi oi, Master! It’s true!” The Venomous Snake grinned. “I’ve figured out that much a long time ago!  Do you have any more practical advice?”  "}
{"text": "“Hey. Why is your disciple talking like that?!” The Heavenly Demon ground her teeth. It was a face  bursting with heat in various ways. “Is that really the dignity of the last disciple of the Righteous Sect?”  "}
{"text": "“Oho. This demon’s got a problem with the way he talks? Then, do you expect children from the  outside world to talk the same way as we do? Or why not? Your disciple... Oh, you said he wasn’t your  disciple yet. Anyway, are you worried that the noob demon will be crushed by my student who speaks  that way?”  "}
{"text": "SMO.  “Disciple! Use the Butterfly Sword and the Precept of Life and Death! You’!] beat him in one round!”  The Venomous Snake’s thick eyebrows wriggled.  "}
{"text": "Below it, in his one eye, there was a deep realization.  “Sure. Is it the [Butterfly Sword] and the [Precept of Life and Death]?”  "}
{"text": "“That’s right! I’d like you to also add the tricks of your everyday martial arts, but is it possible?”  “Fuck, of course it is possible! Master. I’m the Venomous Snake, guildmaster of Chen Mu-mun!”  The Venomous Snake blew his nose and gripped his sword with vigor.  Meanwhile, I was finally able to control my breathing again.  "}
{"text": "As I fixed my posture, the Venomous Snake whispered to me, “Death King.”  “Yes.”  "}
{"text": "“You asked me if I had ever starved?”  “T did. Venomous Snake-nim.”  “Ts that your martial arts?”  "}
{"text": "His question was as sharp as a glance from his single eye.  I replied evenly, “It’s the imagery from the previous blow.”  "}
{"text": "“T thought so.”  The Venomous Snake smirked. Then, he turned his head and smiled.  “T’ll ask it another way, Death King. What do you think is martial arts?”  "}
{"text": "The leader of the Chen Mu-mun asked about martial arts.  It was the same as the Heretic Questioner discussing God, the same as Sword Saint discussing the  "}
{"text": "sword, and the distant future master of the Alchemy Castle discussing medicine, so it was something  that I had to listen to properly.  I would have done the same. If I didn’t meet the Sword Emperor, didn’t learn demonic arts from the  "}
{"text": "Heavenly Demon, and above all, before I read the psychological state of the Sword Emperor.  “T’ll answer it for you!”  "}
{"text": "The Venomous Snake lowered his stance and raised his sword.  Like a venomous viper ready to strike.  "}
{"text": "“Lift your feet! Swing your arms! Make a fist!”  Then, he moved.  No—he flowed.  "}
{"text": "It was as if the Venomous Snake himself had become liquid. Like water flowing from a high spot to a  low spot, he flowed smoothly and gently. Right in front of me.  "}
{"text": "He flowed like that, and in the next moment, bang...!  “Martial arts means—”  I barely blocked the blade that soared up from the bottom to the top.  "}
{"text": "Immediately, the Venomous Snake twisted the blade. The blade ran up against my blade, creating  sparks as it did. The Venomous Snake straightened his sword like that. As if piercing the sky, he stood  upright and slightly bent his wrist. He tilted.  "}
{"text": "Then, he yelled.  “You beat up the little shit in front of you!”  The strikes poured down like rain.  "}
{"text": "“That’s all! You little shit!”  A shower of blades rained on me.  "}
{"text": "“Damn it,” Bang! As soon as I blocked it, “Ah,” bang! The next blow went, “Oh!” The next blow  again, “Damn,” and the abruptly falling blade chewed down on my sword and bit it. In that instant, he  widened the opening I had made. “Ach,” then, swish...! The burrowing blade scratched my cheek.  "}
{"text": "“This...!”  Blood spilled. I narrowly took a few steps back. But—  "}
{"text": "“T won’t miss!”  The Venomous Snake literally followed me, curling up like a serpent.  Again, a slash from the bottom to the top.  "}
{"text": "“Agh.”  As soon as I blocked it, he rose and showered down more blows upon me.  “Damn it.”  "}
{"text": "Damn. He was definitely strong.  He wasn’t ranked highly among hunters for nothing. This Venomous Snake!  "}
{"text": "“Oi oi, Death King! Is that all you have to show after drawing the first blood?”  The Venomous Snake snorted.  "}
{"text": "The burning feeling inside me burst out not from my mouth, but from someone else’s.  “Damn it..!”  It was the Heavenly Demon.  "}
{"text": "“You!”  She bitterly yelled at me.  "}
{"text": "“What are you doing? It’s a shower! It’s water! Doesn’t that sword form resemble rainwater?”  The Heavenly Demon, who had been provoked by the Murim Lord, finally couldn’t keep it in any  longer. The woman shouted at me with her fists clenched.  "}
{"text": "“What are you so afraid of? Receive it and drink!”  The Heavenly Demon was acknowledging this match.  "}
{"text": "She was acknowledging that it was between me, who had become the successor to the Demonic Cult,  and the Venomous Snake, who had become the successor to the Righteous Sect. She was accepting the  fight between the two of us. This was a confrontation between the Demonic Cult and the Righteous  Sect, and we were both accepted as the ‘proxies’ of the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord.  "}
{"text": "“Ha.”  I laughed.  "}
{"text": "“Understood!”  I lifted my stance while holding the sword in reverse.  Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.  "}
{"text": "Second form.  Sword of Thirst.  "}
{"text": "I blocked the pouring attacks of the Venomous Snake before it could start pouring. Then, as if I was  drinking it upside down, I dragged it to my desired path. It spilled.  "}
{"text": "It spilled to the ground.  “Oh.”  The Venomous Snake who had wasted a turn.  "}
{"text": "And I, who had made him waste the turn.  At the moment when our eyes crossed, the voices of the old man and the woman also crossed.  “Disciple! Use the Rotten Leaf Earth Technique! It’s become wet soil...”  "}
{"text": "“Ha! Then make it into a puddle!”  "}
{"text": "The Venomous Snake crouched and took a defensive posture as I simultaneously twisted my sword.  Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.  Third form.  "}
{"text": "Sword of the Drowned.  Very slightly, at an angle.  "}
{"text": "When it’s nearly horizontal, bang! Attack, bang! Make it fly, bang! Matching the Venomous Snake’s  breath, bang! When he blinks, bang! With that.  For the finale, in reverse,  "}
{"text": "Oof, bang...!!  “Fuck...!”  "}
{"text": "The Venomous Snake ground his teeth as his flank was cut.  The Murim Lord shouted,  “Tt’s strong! Fall back!”  "}
{"text": "“Follow!”  the Heavenly Demon yelled.  "}
{"text": "The Venomous Snake retreated, following the Murim Lord’s orders, and I advanced, following the  voice of the Heavenly Demon.  Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.  "}
{"text": "Fourth form.  Sword of Freezing.  “Aaagh, you!”  "}
{"text": "The Venomous Snake was angered.  “You’re a sucker for a fight, really!”  “Venomous Snake-nim is also tough!”  "}
{"text": "“No, you’re really a sucker! Were you a lollipop in a previous life, Death King? How does it stick  together like this?”[3]  "}
{"text": "“Then was Venomous Snake-nim a dog in your previous life?”  As we wondered about each other’s past lives, the Venomous Snake and I clashed swords. A large  amount of snow soared as the winter wind raged.  "}
{"text": "The field became more heated, though.  "}
{"text": "“Break off at a good point, disciple!”  “Hit him properly!”  "}
{"text": "“Don’t block it! Avoid it, even if you have to use the Running Wave! After that, use the Aged Earth  Counterstrike...”  "}
{"text": "“Child! You can’t stop, either! Avoid it!”  There were scars on our skins.  They were increasing in number.  "}
{"text": "Blood splattered, flesh flew away.  Both the Venomous Snake and I had become caked in blood at some point. The open wounds were  buried in the cold wind and quickly hardened into scars.  "}
{"text": "“Oho, Madu, you bitch! Aren’t you the one interfering in their match, now?”  The Murim Lord was scolding her, but he was still laughing.  "}
{"text": "“You’re an old man with only sly serpents in your mind...”  The Heavenly Demon was telling him off, but she was laughing.  "}
{"text": "Whenever the two laughs intersected, the Venomous Snake’s sword clashed with mine.  Neither I nor the Venomous Snake intended to kill each other. There was no intention to kill even in the  war between the Heavenly Demon and the Murim Lord. Therefore, this was not life or death.  "}
{"text": "It wasn’t a fight to kill.  But it was a fight that, if ended, would allow everyone to die.  “Huff, hooo! Haa!”  "}
{"text": "I became the sword of the Heavenly Demon. I fought with all my power in the place of the Heavenly  Demon, whose body had become infected and could not fight without spilling her energy all over.  "}
{"text": "This was the scene that she had lost.  “Haaa!”  "}
{"text": "The Venomous Snake became the sword of the Murim Lord. He ran with all his power in the place of  the Murim Lord, whose whole body was infected and who could not wield an ax without breaking his  spirit.  "}
{"text": "This was a dream that he couldn’t dream of anymore.  All scenes fade.  No matter how brilliant a dream was, it would one day become discolored.  "}
{"text": "Humans all decay.  “Agh...”  "}
{"text": "At some point.  The Heavenly Demon stopped talking.  The woman who was called the greatest of all time in the Murim world slowly covered her face.  "}
{"text": "“You wicked... You wicked things...”  A decaying genre.  A decaying world.  "}
{"text": "“T threw it all away. I threw it away a long time ago, but it’s starting again...”  Only people could abandon people.  Only people could not abandon people.  "}
{"text": "“What do you want...?”  How much time had passed?  "}
{"text": "When neither I nor the Venomous Snake had the strength to lift our swords, our match was over. There  was no winner. There was no loser, either.  "}
{"text": "I put away my sword.  Breathing harshly, I walked with arduous steps. I walked in the snowfield. I walked to the Heavenly  Demon, who was standing with her face covered, and I kneeled on my throbbing knees.  "}
{"text": "“Heavenly Demon-nim.”  I touched the snowfield with trembling hands.  "}
{"text": "“T want to become your disciple.”  I want to be your scene.  "}
{"text": "“T would like to have Heavenly Demon-nim as my teacher.”  I want to be your dream that doesn’t discolor.  “T am called the Death King.”  "}
{"text": "I hope your scene leads to my scene, your dream leads to my dream, and your life leads to my life.  “My real name is Kim Gongja.”  It was a period when all sincerity was mocked.  "}
{"text": "I want to support you so no one can laugh at you.  “Please accept me as your disciple.”  "}
{"text": "Please keep living.  That was what I said.  "}

{"text": "Snowflakes fluttered in the wind for a long time before falling from the sky to the snowy field. There  were countless snowflakes. And one snowflake came to rest on one woman’s dark hair. The white  melted in the black and flowed down.  "}

{"text": "“The stages of the Demonic Cult are largely divided into four.”  To me, who would soon become a disciple, the Heavenly Demon gave an ancient lesson.  "}
{"text": "“The first stage is ‘ipma,’ or rising demon. Rising demons are those who know how to talk about their  pain. The cultists who enter our sect speak with a sword, not with words. Therefore, the rising demon is  a person who knows how to speak of his pain with a sword.”  "}
{"text": "I bowed again.  After hunger was thirst, and I pictured seawater in my heart.  "}
{"text": "“The second stage is gukma, or extreme demon. The extreme demon is someone who knows how to  speak of the pain of others. Therefore, the extreme demon refers to a person who can use a sword to  deal with the pain of others.”  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon silently accepted my second salute.  I bowed again, drawing the image of the drowned father in my heart.  "}
{"text": "“The third stage is talma, or elusive demon.”  Again, the Heavenly Demon nodded.  She was willing to accept my third salute.  "}
{"text": "“The elusive demon is someone who knows how to talk about the pain of everyone. The elusive demon  can walk down the street and easily feel what makes the person passing by him suffer.”  "}
{"text": "I did the fourth salute.  “Tt is extremely rare for anyone to reach this level! Even in the history of our sect, the number of  "}
{"text": "elusive demons can be counted on one hand. The great me is an elusive demon.”  Again, the Heavenly Demon accepted my bow.  "}
{"text": "“Finally, there is the stage of sinma, the demonic god. The demonic god knows not only the suffering  of all men but the suffering of all things. It is said that he can speak of the pain of all things in creation.  But this is a theoretical stage! So I will just skip over that stage. In fact, no one has ever reached the  stage of a demonic god.”  "}

{"text": "“Both of you have to come.”  “Huh...?”  Master and the Murim Lord looked at each other. They seemed to have noticed that I wasn’t suggesting  "}
{"text": "a normal walk. Their expression showed that they didn’t know what it was about but were interested.  “T understand. My disciple must have some secret plans. I don’t want to walk with this old fool, but I’m  willing to be tricked by my dull-witted disciple.”  "}
{"text": "“Well. Since a baby demon plotted it, it’s probably no big deal. I don’t expect much at all.”  We left the cave.  "}
{"text": "It was cold. Just like it was on the first day we fell into the [Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon], it was  still winter.  "}
{"text": "What was different from that day was that neither Master nor the Murim Lord could use their chi. They  wouldn’t be able to use it forever.  With my right hand, I held Master’s hand. With my left, I held the hand of the Murim Lord. That way, I  "}

{"text": "The two leaned against my warmth and crossed the cold winter road.  “But I thought of something else.”  "}
{"text": "Was it because it was the first time they were going out in a week? Or was it their bodies, which they  had to use without their inner energy, that was unfamiliar? The steps of Master and the Murim Lord  were a little clumsy.  "}

{"text": "Master snickered. It seemed that she thought it was a funny joke.  “All right. Since it’s a ghost of the greatest fighter in another world that my student summoned, I’ll pay  attention. I’ll happily accept you as my opponent for a battle of wits.”  "}
{"text": "I looked at Bae Hu-ryeong.  Bae Hu-ryeong continued to sit in silence.  "}
{"text": "“Well. What kind of move does the number one ghost have to offer?”  “_..He said he would yield the move to Master.”  "}
{"text": "“Hmm?”  “He said that he would yield the first three moves to you, Master.”  A bit of the smile disappeared from Master’s expression.  "}
{"text": "“What a maniac. My disciple would never say such a thing. It must be the ghost that does not know his  place. Then, with the fifth blade of the Twelve Cloud Dragon Swords, the Outward Dragon Quick  Sword, I pierce the water blood point.”  "}
{"text": "The first move.  "}
{"text": "-I shall use the sixth form of the Earth Dragon Style, Western River Cave Dragon, feinting and then  retreating with the Floating Cloud Step.  Bae Hu-ryeong responded without hesitation.  "}
{"text": "I didn’t know what the [Twelve Cloud Dragon Swords] nor the [Earth Dragon Style] was. The only  thing I knew was the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art. I was just calmly communicating their fight with  my mouth.  "}
{"text": "“He used the sixth form of the Earth Dragon Style, Western River Cave Dragon, feinting, and then used  the Floating Cloud Step to retreat.”  "}
{"text": "“Hmm ”  Master furrowed her brows.  "}
{"text": "“Then I will blow him away with the seventh form of the Ultimate Mysterious Art, the expected  reaction.”  -I shall avoid it and feint with the second move of the Six Boxing Attacks, Double Sheet Attack.  "}
{"text": "Master’s elegant eyebrows crinkled a little more.  “T will attack with the sixth form of Six Equal Grave Swords, Sword of Disinterment.”  -I use my Perching Duck Kick. I step back with the All Blossom Chaotic Step.  "}
{"text": "Three turns ended in an instant.  I couldn’t understand what kind of battle was unfolding between the two.  "}
{"text": "However, Master was silent.  -You.  Bae Hu-ryeong calmly opened his mouth.  "}
{"text": "-I can roughly imagine how you lived. After climbing to the top rank in your sect, you devoted yourself  to your group without time for training. You could have entered the stage of life and death, but you  didn’t. Why? Because you were busy. 24 hours in a day is not enough to take care of a sect. You must  "}
{"text": "have been busy taking care of your family, the members of your cult. What time would you have had for  training?  But, said Bae Hu-ryeong.  "}
{"text": "-You know what’s the most unfair part of this?  The corer of his mouth twisted.  -Even like this, you were still the strongest.  "}
{"text": "You had no reason to aim higher.  -Why? You’re already at the top. It was enough to survive, and everyone acknowledged your strength.  There was no need to try. Because you were literally their god.  "}
{"text": "-Poor thing. Your misfortune is that you were the absolute strongest in this world.  Bae Hu-ryeong crossed his arms.  "}
{"text": "-Let me show you what a god among gods is like.  I didn’t repeat these words to her.  I didn’t feel like there was a need to.  "}
{"text": "“Hm.”  Master slowly raised her head.  Her light body leaned on mine a little.  "}
{"text": "With that, she sat up in the snow.  “You’re not just for show.”  "}
{"text": "The Heavenly Demon.  From the Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon.  The strongest of all time.  "}
{"text": "Demonic Cult.  -Of course. Who do you think I am?  Sword Emperor.  "}
{"text": "From the World of a Thousand Blades.  The strongest being under the heavens.  Righteous Sect.  "}
{"text": "“Fine. I shall take you seriously.”  -Come at me.  "}
{"text": "A martial arts match.  It began now.  "}
{"text": "oF  “T use the first form of the Flaming Blood Dragon, Ascending Explosion to strike your chin.”  -You’re suddenly acting like the Righteous Sect, for some reason. With the upward momentum, I’ Il  "}
{"text": "continuously use the Eight Great Cloud Dragon Techniques for one second. While one hand was being  gathered into a fist, the other hand struck.  One turn.  "}
{"text": "“T’ll use the third form of the Assassination Sword, the Scholar’s Strike, to attack your fortune spring  point and kill the momentum of your Ascending Explosion.”  "}
{"text": "-Oh, interesting. What should I do? Should I receive it, or... All right. I’ll use the Precept of Life and  Death along with Cove Surge Thread.  "}
{"text": "Another turn.  As the battle of wits continued, Master started to run out of breath.  The white breath of winter turned even whiter.  "}
{"text": "Master closed her left hand and squeezed my knee tightly. With her right hand, she clenched my hand.  She was trembling. Master’s trembling passed on to me through her hands.  “_..How long are you going to keep your dirty foot over my fingers? I’ll tear it off with Burning Leech  "}
{"text": "Boss Plate, the second form of the Three Seeds Demonic Scriptures.”  -I was only matching your aura. What a ferocious temper you have! I’Il immediately take my feet off  and onto the air with Running Wave, simultaneously using the fourth form of Great Godly Chariot  "}
{"text": "Rotation, Living Death, to hit the right giant bone, sun valley, and spirit home pressure points at the  same time.  “T will take three steps back with Heavenly Demon Step!”  "}
{"text": "Master was delighted.  -Since you pretended to be the Righteous Sect, should I try to imitate the Demonic Cult’s techniques,  too? They responded with the other sect’s moves.  "}
{"text": "That was right.  The Murim Lord, the Ax Saint, was never really Master’s [rival].  "}
{"text": "It was true that the Murim Lord was the strongest member of the Righteous Sect in this world. He was  the only one who was able to stand against Master. But wasn’t it proven in the final battle? When the  two fought each other with all their power, it was Master who eventually won.  "}
{"text": "The game had a fixed ending.  Maybe that was why Master delayed the conclusion of the Battle of Good and Evil 990 times.  "}
{"text": "She was like a child who cherished and savored a piece of candy as long as possible because she knew  it would melt away.  "}
{"text": "[I’m sorry. |  That was why in the bad ending, the Murim Lord said those words to Master.  [I’m sorry I’m weaker than you. |  [I was weaker than you. |  "}
{"text": "[Kill me. |  Clasp.  Without realizing it, I tightened my grip.  “A foolish act! I attack your face with the second form of Assassination Sword!”  "}
{"text": "-You wish. I use the Iron Burning Plate to evade your attack, and this time, I use Ascending Explosion  on your other side.  "}
{"text": "“Aha.”  Master finally smiled. It wasn’t a sad smile, nor a smile that looked like it would evaporate away. It  was a bright laugh, backed by the pounding of her heart.  "}
{"text": "“Disciple. The ghost you brought in is the best!”  "}
{"text": "Now I could fully understand the feelings of the Murim Lord.  “He’s probably the strongest person I know.”  “Where were you hiding these ghosts, and why are you only introducing them to me now?”  "}
{"text": "I was a little upset.  “T’ve never met such a powerful martial artist before!”  "}
{"text": "No.  I was very upset.  “T twist your arm and stop your force. And I take four steps back with Heavenly Demon Step!”  "}
{"text": "-Hmm. You’ve already gone back three steps, and now you’re going another four. Are you running back  with your tail between your legs? I go forward with the Floating Cloud Step and follow you, then use  Sudden Midsummer Rain. I then carry it out with Sword Force.  "}
{"text": "“Ha! Sword Force with Sudden Midsummer Rain? I guess you’re tired of searching for me. Fine then. I  use the Sword of Thirst to strike upward against you, then use the first three forms of Lower Sand to  strike the heaven pillar, nape, and life pillar all in a row!”  "}
{"text": "For me... The match between the two was incomprehensible.  I couldn’t even imagine the fight in my head.  "}
{"text": "I understood the Sword of Thirst. However, I didn’t know what [Lower Sand Dragon] was. I knew  what Running Wave was. However, I didn’t know what sort of form [Living Death of the Great Godly  Chariot Rotation] was.  "}
{"text": "It all kept going over my head, and I wasn’t even allowed to hesitate while trying to picture it.  I could not see the match between the two at all.  "}
{"text": "-You have to attack like that. Great! I use the Butterfly Sword Style’s Precept of Life and Death to  dodge and step back, then use Ultimate Fertile Heaven Sword!  “Not bad. Not bad at all!”  "}
{"text": "Ah...  If possible, I wanted to become her rival.  "}
{"text": "If possible, I wanted to monopolize her hopes and be the one to grant her wishes.  I wanted her to spend the last of her life happy because of me.  But I couldn’t see it.  "}
{"text": "What I can see and hear, at best, was:  “Good. I’ll use the mm technique to get out of the way.”  -I’ll respond with mm, the third form of s™™ Sword Style!  "}
{"text": "Only something like this.  I could not see the swords of the two masters.  "}
{"text": "“All right. I?ll counter with the second form, mm of am.”  -I’ll follow up with the =m method of smmum!  The words didn’t make sense.  "}
{"text": "“Fine. ll stab your @m and @@ with Smmm’s mmm Sword Style!”  -You sure are ina hurry. I’ll dodge using smu, then use suum to aim at your neck.  “T’ll deflect it, then use the tenth form of Sm, HEMMB, to attack your Samm!”  "}

{"text": "“SE88, using #88 to BH and saa.”  It was dark.  "}
{"text": "I was far from reaching their playing field.  “After deflecting it...... i  "}
{"text": "It was then.  Master, who was breathless, looked back at me.  Suddenly, time seemed to stop.  "}
{"text": "Master’s gaze.  The silent gaze stayed on my face.  "}
{"text": "There was a small smile on Master’s lips.  “Disciple. The day is cold.”  "}
{"text": "“The season repeatedly falls into winter, and so this area is known as a permanent snowfield. The  snowfield is a harsh battleground. When you step forward, you often fall into the snow, so you have to  continue using movement skills.”  "}
{"text": "Master touched the snowfield with her finger.  The porous snow was smeared on Master’s fingertips.  “So a battle on the snowfield always focuses on breaking the other person’s posture. Disciple. Do you  "}
{"text": "understand? You don’t have to stubbomly cut off the person’s head or stab their back. It is enough to  push them until they can’t hold their movement skill.”  “That’s why your ghost and I are trying to take over each other’s space. If you steal their space, your  "}
{"text": "opponent will have a smaller range of movement.”  Master.  "}
{"text": "“There’s also a reason why we are using kicks. It isn’t just to hit the other person. Kicks scatter the  snow and obscured the other’s sight. Mm. It’s quite a frantic fight. Isn’t it?”  "}
{"text": "Master whispered in my ear.  “Close your eyes.”  Master’s left hand slowly covered my eyes.  "}
{"text": "“Can you picture your master’s opponent?”  “Tt is a strong and noble master. He’s a large man. He’s nearly twice my size. Right?”  "}
{"text": "In my head, I pictured Bae Hu-ryeong.  “Yes.”  "}
{"text": "“The giant, bear-like master is breathing unevenly. He’s urging you to attack and smiling confidently.  There is a big difference in our physiques. Of course he’s confident....”  "}
{"text": "The more Master spoke, the clearer Bae Hu-ryeong’s figure became in my mind.  “How can I overcome the difference in our natural physiques? I have to accept it. Accept it, but think of  "}
{"text": "my own strengths. I am able to move faster than him. Most of all, Iam more familiar with the  snowfield. And I am more adept in using my skills than he is....”  “Yes.”  "}
{"text": "“Play the long game. Do you understand, disciple? I am aiming for a drawn-out battle.”  Master laughed, then said playfully,  “But my opponent sees through my intentions. His movements become impatient. His sword cuts  "}
{"text": "faster. He’s running toward me like a wild boar—.”  Soon.  "}
{"text": "“But there is nothing to be scared of. I had already foreseen this. I step back, lightly, retreat back—.”  My eyes.  “T drag him in.”  "}
{"text": "The landscape was drawn before my eyes.  “IT keep walking backwards. My footsteps continue to be light. He acts like a wild boar, rushing in and  throwing snow around in all directions—.”  "}
{"text": "The winter repeated, and the world turned into a permanent snowfield.  Master stepped back.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong rushed forward.  “—Snowflakes fly away with each step we take.”  I, too, started to be able to see their swords.  "}

{"text": "“Tt’s snowing.”  Master’s footsteps were light.  "}
{"text": "“Tt has already been two days since our match began.”  She stepped lightly, so lightly on the snowfield as if she would slip on the ice.  A world covered in white.  "}
{"text": "The black hem of Master’s clothes flowed like a brush on white paper.  -How long are you going to run away?  There was another brush following after her.  "}
{"text": "Its strokes were tougher, stronger, and more intense than Master’s. It was a brush dipped heavily in ink  and pressed hard on the paper.  "}
{"text": "-If it’s a movement skill, I won't lose to you.  With heavy steps, Bae Hu-ryeong broke the ice under his feet, rushing forward where his gaze hit like a  "}

{"text": "“Don’t you know? This world is an endless field of snow. There may be no place to go, but there is an  infinite number of places to run.”  "}
{"text": "-I won't leave you be.  Bae Hu-ryeong kicked the snow with a chwak, dashing forward.  "}
{"text": "-If you were in your prime, maybe you could run away forever. But this match is between us as we are  now. If we’re counting the rest of your life, you don’t even have two hours left. The sand in your glass is  falling quickly. Are you still going to run away?  "}
{"text": "“Oho. How unfair.”  -Life is unfair.  Bae Hu-ryeong swung his sword.  "}
{"text": "“You have a point.”  Master turned her head and easily avoided the attack.  "}
{"text": "“T don’t have much time left to live. I can’t continue running away.”  -At some point, we have to end the match.  "}
{"text": "“There’s no reason that that point shouldn’t be now.”  -Now you’re talking my language.  “If so.” Master grabbed the hilt of her sword. “I shall show you my maximum power.”  "}
{"text": "Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.  First form.  Sword of Starvation.  "}
{"text": "“—Starvation, like parents exchanging their own child with their neighbors’ to eat them.”  The sword parted the winter wind with a scream.  "}
{"text": "“Have you heard the tale of an adult who baked the neighbor’s child into jerky and buried them in the  snow? Have you heard the rumors in the village? Did you hear that if you dig at the snow on the side of  the village road, your shovel will discover young flesh at each plow?”  "}
{"text": "-How sad.  Shiiing.  Bae Hu-ryeong blocked Master’s blade with his sword.  "}
{"text": "-It must have been a famine year.  “That’s right. A famine is like an epidemic that always returns.”  -But that’s just chance.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong was hit by the cold gust, and swung his sword again.  -Good harvests happen by chance, as do famines. It’s nothing more than coincidence. Sect leader, if  "}

{"text": "The two swords clashed.  A red plum flower fell.  "}
{"text": "-So, I shall sing of the happy autumn harvest.  Snowflakes descended like falling leaves.  "}
{"text": "-There are days when I looked at the horizon as I walked down the street. It was a day when the golden  sea of rice stalks stretched to the horizon.

{"text": "Autumn.  The wind blew.  The mountains and fields turned red with autumn leaves, and the horizon turned yellow with rice stalks.  "}

{"text": "It was a world full of crimson maple leaves fluttering to the ground.  Bae Hu-ryeong swung the sword.  -Either way, the days are both results of chance. If I have to put something into my heart as I swing my  "}

{"text": "Infernal Heavens Demonic Art.  Second form.  Sword of Thirst.  "}
{"text": "“Both cases are by chance, you say. Of course it is. But happiness does not kill a person. The suffering  from starvation, the pain of thirst, can kill! And if you die, you’re dead forever. It’s the end.”  "}

{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong parried the sword, but Master did not back down. Rather, she clung to him even closer.  It was close combat. They were so close to each other that they could feel the opponent’s breath.  Chaang! Shing! Sword quickly countered sword, so fast to make one’s eyes dizzy.  "}
{"text": "-If you wash and swim in the summer, it’s really cool.  Bae Hu-ryeong parried Master’s quick sword.  "}

{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong’s sword flowed like water.  -It’s good to talk about the pain of the world. It’s also good to look at other people’s suffering. But that  isn’t something to be done forever.  "}

{"text": "A talk.  “What kind of thing are you going to tell me after making my colleagues faint?”  "}
{"text": "“Ah, [colleague]. As expected, Death King-nim! You can regard them as tiresome, useless luggage, but  you say it so naturally that you think of them as colleagues. I have no choice but to shed another tear at  the admirable heart of Death King-nim.”  "}

{"text": "The Librarian tiptoed and started to cut my hair with a snip, snip. He didn’t cut much. Maybe about  half of the hair from the back of my head?

{"text": "for their nails. I’ll clip them.”  The Librarian pulled another object out of his sleeves.  "}

{"text": "“There’s nothing you don’t like about that person, from their toes to their head. It’s love. It truly is a  noble and pure love. But the problem is that the person doesn’t exist in reality, but only on paper. It is a  character that exists only in a novel.”  "}

{"text": "After burning up a silk pouch of unpleasant things (there was a terrible scream involved), the Librarian  and I managed to start talking for real.  "}

{"text": "The Librarian cocked his head to the side. My question seemed to be unfamiliar to him.  “Why? Hmm. Does a book need a specific reason to be an Apocalypse?”  “T think so.”  "}
{"text": "I put my shoes back on.  “Librarian-nim, do you like happy endings? Or do you prefer sad endings?”  “Both of them have their merits,” the Librarian replied immediately.  "}
{"text": "“An ending is like a port where the characters’ lives come to a conclusion. Life can be happy, or it can  be rough! A general reader wants the characters to be happy, but I also want to hug them tightly when  they fail or are sad.”  "}
{"text": "“Which means that even unhappy endings are still proper conclusions.”  “Yes. Obviously.”  “That’s why I have more questions.”  "}
{"text": "I grabbed the Librarian’s wrist, which was trying to go behind my back, and took away the scissors.  The Librarian hopped up and down, trying to take back the scissors, but he wasn’t tall enough.  "}
{"text": "“Even if I didn’t interfere, the [Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon] would have a proper conclusion.  Even if it is sad.”  "}
{"text": "“Master and the Murim Lord did their best up to the end. They continued making an effort. Even  though the Murim Lord died first and Master went mad... Master still reached the conclusion.”  I looked into the Librarian’s eyes.  "}
{"text": "“Why was [The Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon] included as an Apocalypse? Library director-nim.  Why didn’t the Murim Lord’s death and Master’s madness count as a proper ending?”  "}
{"text": "In fact, I was thinking about this question ever since I saw the fairy tale, ‘Me and Our Scapegoat’.  Apart from whether or not I could accept the ending, the world looked like it had reached a logical  conclusion.  "}
{"text": "The Constellation was silent.  In the library, there were only the quiet breaths of the knocked-out hunters. Saek, seeeek.... Among the  "}
{"text": "rising and falling of the Hunters’ chests, the Librarian was expressionless.  “T wanted to see a happy ending for some reason. Would something like that reason not work?”  “If you don’t like the ending, Librarian-nim can fix it yourself.”  "}
{"text": "“Librarian-nim is strong. In the eyes of a Hunter like me, you seem to be omnipotent and omniscient.  But even so, instead of fixing the apocalypse, you sent us.”  "}
{"text": "In other words, this Constellation was a ‘reader’.  He was a reader who didn’t want to intervene in the story but just receive it as it was. He had no desire  "}
{"text": "to ever be a ‘writer’. He could correct the wrongs, but he refused to do so.  A reader who would never intervene himself.  The Corner Librarian.  "}
{"text": "“Shall I do a character analysis, too? A thorough person like you would not call something an  Apocalypse just because the ending was weird.

{"text": "sat Ah, you won’t just let this go.”  The Librarian smiled bitterly.  "}
{"text": "“Follow me.”  The Librarian grabbed my hand. With the other hand, he picked up a book.  The title of the book was the Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon.  "}

{"text": "“Correct.”  The Librarian nodded.  "}
{"text": "“His nickname is the Constellation Killer. He is a person who crosses the boundaries of the world and  kills Constellations.”  "}

{"text": "“Since you asked, I’ll give you a special answer. For a long time, I have had a dream.”  “A dream, you say?”  “Exactly. It is to make an appearance in a novel that I enjoy!”  "}

{"text": "“Tf it’s appearing in a novel... Can’t you do that right now? You can freely travel through the  Apocalypses.”  “Huhu. You don’t understand the reader’s mind, I see. [Appearing] in a novel is a bit different from  "}

{"text": "“From the Apocalypses’ perspective, I am no different than an alien matter. An alien matter, an invasive  species... An existence that should not naturally occur in that world. The Constellation Killer, who  killed the dragon in the Murim world, is on the same level as I am in terms of being a foreign body.”  "}
{"text": "“But I do not want to intervene in a novel as an outsider! Nope. That’s not allowed. I want to appear as  a respectable character who has been in the world from the beginning, just like the other characters!  This is my dream as a reader of the world!”  "}
{"text": "I still didn’t understand.  The Librarian looked at my face and laughed.  “Then, this time, I’ll ask. Gongja. Why didn’t you kill the Heavenly Demon?”  "}
{"text": "“The Heavenly Demon mastered how to kill with her mind in her final moments. Even though she was  no longer as strong as she was in her prime, you could have used the Hundred Ghost skill on her and  make use of her memories.

{"text": "“There are still many Jiangshi on the 22nd floor. Which means there are many mobs. And there are a  lot of ruined channels everywhere. There are also many dungeons.”  "}
{"text": "“Yeah. So, our Chen Mu-mun will have our base right there......  “That’s...... Hunters who want to go to the 22nd floor, visit the 20th floor before...... vaccinated at my  new pharmacy...... Is that it?”  "}
{"text": "“That’s right. In the process, I get a commission...... That’s common sense.”  I, the owner of the 20th floor; the Alchemist, building a new nest on the 20th floor; and Chen Mu-Mun,  who would move its headquarters to the 22nd floor, all benefited.  "}
{"text": "‘Nice. I didn’t think that the day would come when I would get commission from real estate.’  I felt very happy.  "}

{"text": "Though he yelled so loudly, the Medicine King’s business was going through a rough patch. The merit  of the Medicine King’s pharmacy was that it handled high-end medicine. However, as soon as the  super-competent Alchemist appeared, the high-end strategy had become awkward.  "}
{"text": "Everyone knew it, including the Medicine King. Eventually, when he was asked several times, the  Medicine King groaned.  "}

{"text": "“Yes, please. ...... I was in need of a doctor who could take care of Master exclusively.”  “Hmph. Well, that man is easier to talk to than Marcus. All right.

{"text": "“Your voice is......  “Yes! I changed the structure of my vocal cords slightly.”  Grin.  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner smiled.  “People already tell me that my voice is androgynous. A little adjustment makes it more appropriate.  Aha, but I can’t judge my own voice objectively! So how is it?”  "}

{"text": "“Thank you!”  “Hm.”  I stroked my chin.  "}
{"text": "Unexpectedly, we possessed the roles of the [female lead and her butler]. But the Heretic Questioner  and I could cope with that. The Heretic Questioner had his holy techniques....  "}

{"text": "The Heretic Questioner peeked up and looked at my face.  “Your expression has relaxed a little.”  “Excuse me?”  "}

{"text": "that Death King wouldn’t be able to show his skills due to his sadness, but my worry was baseless.”  “_,. Anyway, are you saying you can guess someone’s emotions by looking at their face?”  "}
{"text": "“Yes! I don’t know how it feels to be depressed, but I can understand it conceptually! Haha. Machines  creak when grease gets stuck. Stress may be humanity’s grease. If it sticks around for a long time, it  clumps together and becomes difficult to clean, so take care!”  "}
{"text": "How fascinating. Was he trying to understand humans in his own way? He was a psycho, but he was a  praiseworthy psycho.  "}
{"text": "“By the way, Death King.”  “Yes.”  “Something struck me as strange from earlier.”  "}
{"text": "“What’s strange?”  “From my understanding, we’re currently being imprisoned unlawfully. Our freedom of movement is  suppressed.”  "}
{"text": "“That is also how I understand our situation.”  "}
{"text": "“I’m glad we see it the same way! And usually in this sort of case, guards are set up to monitor the  prisoners. Otherwise, we can easily try to escape.”  The Heretic Questioner tilted his head.  "}
{"text": "“Now, I can’t feel any presence outside the door, but I do feel a presence at the window. Hmm. In this  world, do they place guards at the windows, not in front of the doors?”  "}
{"text": "At that moment.  “Damn it! Attack!”  "}
{"text": "Shadows jumped in from the window as the iron bars fell out.  “Tt doesn’t matter if you kill the man! Just don’t hurt the woman!”  "}
{"text": "The shadows were wearing masks on their faces. Their outfit concept was too grim for them to be  guests who had come to check on us out of worry. Anybody could see that it was a surprise attack by  unwelcome gatecrashers.  "}
{"text": "“Shiny!”  [Yes, warrior. ]  I pulled out the Holy Sword. Chaang! My sword clashed against the attacker’s sword.  "}
{"text": "The back-and-forth wasn’t much different from the attack scenes shown in movies. The conversation  could be summarized with: ‘Who are you!’ ‘You don’t need to know! But we have a powerful backer!’  Both my opponent and I were busy swinging our swords.  "}

{"text": "I did as he said.  The Heretic Questioner was also playing an active role as the hem of his dress fluttered.  “Impossible! T-this isn’t an ordinary girl!”  "}
{"text": "The attackers were astonished. They weren’t particularly skilled. No, was it our skills that were too  great? Small fry that couldn’t even use Aura couldn’t handle us.  "}
{"text": "In the end, the four attackers were quickly overpowered. One of them was killed by the Heretic  Questioner during the fight.  “Ahem. Ahaha.”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner smoothly wiped off the blood that had gotten on his face with the sleeve of his  dress. The attackers looked up at that Heretic Questioner. Their faces were pale with fear.  "}
{"text": "“T heard she was a weak noble girl... How did this...>?”  “Everyone, you have three options!”  The Heretic Questioner beamed, holding a dagger.  "}
{"text": "“First, if you ask me to kill you right here, you’ll just die! Second, I can torture you in turn and get you  to reveal any important information! Third, you can obediently confess everything, and you won’t be  tortured or killed! Which option do you choose?”  "}
{"text": "“Huh....”  The person who seemed to be the oldest among the assailants scoffed. It was the man whose wrist I  "}
{"text": "broke.  “Crazy bitch. I’d rather die!”  "}
{"text": "“Yes! Understood!”  “What?”  The Heretic Questioner’s dress turned a little redder.  "}
{"text": "A dull, percussive sound rang through the warehouse.  His head had fallen to the floor.  "}
{"text": "“Hii, hiiik...?!”  Two attackers were left.  “Everyone, have you finished making your choice?”  "}
{"text": "“P-please spare us. Young Miss. We were just hired to do this!”  “Tt’s hard to survive in this world. I understand.”  "}
{"text": "“Then...”  "}
{"text": "“But just as I understand your situation, you must understand my position! Please tell us why you  attacked us. In exchange, I’ ll let you go alive. I think I’m making a lot of concessions in this deal.”  The attackers wavered.  "}
{"text": "“Ah. You seem to be hesitating. I understand! I’ll help you a little so you can make up your mind!”  “That. When you say help us....”  “T’Il whip you into shape.”  "}
{"text": "As always, the Heretic Questioner was smiling.  “Pain is proof that you are alive. When one’s pain reaches its maximum, one’s survival instinct also  "}
{"text": "peaks. All right. I'll maximize your desire to live.”  “S, Spare us!”  "}
{"text": "“Please save us!”  This was insane.  I intervened because the genre would change to an R19 romance at this rate.  "}
{"text": "“Please wait a minute. Heretic Questioner.”  “What is it?”  “You don’t have to do it like that. Please leave it to me.”  "}
{"text": "“Hmmm...?”  The Heretic Questioner made a puzzled expression.  "}
{"text": "“Death King, are you good at torture? Unless you’re very skilled at it, I recommend that you let me  handle this. I am an interrogation specialist.”  "}
{"text": "“No, there’s no need to torture them. Also, please wipe your face.”  I handed a handkerchief to the Heretic Questioner and stood in front of our attackers.  "}
{"text": "The attackers sighed in relief. I felt sorry for them, but I wasn’t about to be generous to people who had  attacked us first.  “Misters. Let me ask you something.”  "}
{"text": "“W-what is it?”  “You came through the window when you attacked just now. The iron bars were cut too easily. Did you  hear that we would be trapped here and cut the iron bars in advance?”  "}
{"text": "The attackers did not respond. They only traded glances with each other. However, it didn’t mean there  wasn’t a way to figure out the right answer just because they were keeping their mouths shut.  ‘Character window.’  "}
{"text": "I could see their psychological states.  [I heard that a woman would enter the warehouse. |  "}
{"text": "{ Damn it. I heard she was an ordinary girl, but it was a scam! |  As expected.  The attackers already knew we would be here.  "}
{"text": "“While you were attacking us, you yelled, [It doesn’t matter if you kill the man, just don’t hurt the  woman]. Were you trying to kidnap this young lady here?”  "}
{"text": "“Well, that...... That is...... es  The attackers’ eyes flickered.  [It was a request to kidnap the woman here. |  "}
{"text": "| The client said firmly to never injure the girl. That’s why we attacked in a group of four, to be  safe. |  Hmm.  "}
{"text": "Yeah. I got it.  “Haa....”  I sighed. When I looked back, the Heretic Questioner was working hard to wipe his face with the  "}
{"text": "handkerchief. He looked like a baby hamster gnawing on sunflower seeds.  “T think I know who the culprit is.”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner’s ears perked up. “Oh? Do you really know it already?”  “Yes.”  “T want to hear Death King’s reasoning.”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner’s eyes were sparkling.  I nodded and whispered, “To start with, the culprit is someone very powerful. They need to be able to  hire four assassins that can infiltrate the academy, which is impossible without knowing the academy’s  "}
{"text": "security system.”  “Ooh. It makes sense!”  "}
{"text": "However, the Heretic Questioner raised a counterpoint.  “Does the culprit really need to be [someone very powerful]? It isn’t the royal palace; it seems  "}
{"text": "relatively easy to figure out the academy’s security. Even someone with just a little bit of power to their  name can do it!”  “That’s a keen point, but...”  "}
{"text": "I shook my head.  “There is one more suspicious circumstance. Heretic Questioner. Do you remember what [Villainous  Young Lady] shouted when she chased us out?”  "}
{"text": "“Mhm.”  The Heretic Questioner contemplated whether he should put the handkerchief in his sleeves or not.  "}
{"text": "“Yes, I remember. She clearly said [Quickly clean up that master and servant and get them away from  my sight. Lock them up]. Why do you ask?”  "}
{"text": "“She never mentioned where to lock us up.”  “The villainous young lady just said to take us out of the ballroom. But these attackers knew where we  were going to be locked, and they cut off the iron bars in advance. And the ones who brought us to this  "}
{"text": "warehouse were the servants of the villainous lady.”  “Oho ”  The Heretic Questioner’s eyes narrowed, razor-thin.  "}
{"text": "“Indeed. It could be that the villainous young lady was the one who hired the attackers. All she had to  do was tell the servants where to put us in advance and let the attackers know, too. Aha. And since she’s  the daughter of a duke, she has power.”  "}
{"text": "“Yes. But—”  “But it’s too obvious.”  The Heretic Questioner stroked his chin.  "}
{"text": "“[I] am the protagonist of this Apocalypse. I’m a noble lady having a fling with the crown prince. If the  villainous young lady chased me away and I was attacked at that location? Even as the duke’s daughter,  it’1l be a tremendous scandal! The evil act has too much political burden.”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner was definitely quick-witted.  He understood this strange story very swiftly.  "}
{"text": "“In other words, the villainous young lady is not the culprit. The true culprit is the one who wants that  lady to appear [as if she were the culprit].”  "}
{"text": "“T agree!”  “And this real culprit cares so much about the Heretic Questioner that he told the attackers to [never  hurt the woman]. But they didn’t care whether I, as the male butler, died or not. Finally, the culprit is  "}
{"text": "powerful enough to buy off the servants of a duke.”  “Ahaha.”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner smiled with his eyes.  “I’m starting to see who the real culprit is!”  “You probably think the same thing as I do.”  "}
{"text": "“Mm. I don’t know the feeling of love. But I know about the habits of someone in love! If the real  culprit actually cares about [me] as Death King speculated, these attackers can never tell us their  personal information.”  "}
{"text": "“Yes.”  I nodded.  “They must be waiting nearby so they can enter anytime.”  "}
{"text": "Kwaang!  It was then that the old door of the warehouse was broken. Dust rose up, and a group of knights poured  in.  "}
{"text": "At the front was a man who looked like he had never dirtied his hand in his life.  “Sylvia! Are you all right, Sylvia?!”  "}
{"text": "The man ran at us and tightly hugged the Heretic Questioner. Blond hair that looked like uncooked  ramen noodles wobbled in the air. He wasn’t as handsome as the Heretic Questioner, but that man was  also handsome. His level was around... say, 60% of the Heretic Questioner?  "}
{"text": "“Good heavens. Your whole body is covered in blood! When I heard that you had been kicked out of  the ballroom, I was anxious and came to find you.... How dare this vicious thing happen.......!  "}
{"text": "And perhaps his psychopath level was about 60% of the Heretic Questioner as well.  Without blinking once, the man gave an order.  “Look here! Go catch the suspicious men right now! I will interrogate them myself and find out who is  "}

{"text": "The duchy’s servants became indignant at the waltz of the Heretic Questioner’s tongue. Some of the  attendants had probably betrayed their master and belonged to the crown prince. I didn’t know if it was  just one or if there were more traitors, but that wasn’t what mattered now.  "}
{"text": "“T apologize!”  I hurriedly intervened between the gold and silver ladies.  The Lady of the Silver Lily furrowed her brows.  "}

{"text": "from the beginning.  “Excuse me, butler. What are you talking about?”  "}
{"text": "Rather, it was the Heretic Questioner, the Lady of the Golden Silk, who protested.  “T still have a lot to say to her ladyship. You can’t just end the conversation at will......  “Be quiet.”  "}
{"text": "I grabbed the Heretic Questioner’s wrist. I grabbed it, then walked away while dragging him behind  me. The Heretic Questioner said, “Ah, wait, butler! Wait a minute!” He struggled, but I never let go of  his wrist. We really couldn’t let our character immersions rise here.  "}
{"text": "“Milady.”  Just before exiting the hallway, I looked back. The Lady of the Silver Lily was looking at us with an  "}

{"text": "“T have always admired the upright conduct of the duchy’s servants. Tonight, your attendants were  quite virtuous, unlike a common man like myself.”  "}
{"text": "I politely bowed my head to her.  “T have realized many things. This humble self pays respect to your ladyship.”  “Now, please excuse us.”  "}
{"text": "With that, I pulled the Heretic Questioner out of the hall.  The Heretic Questioner, who was rebellious at first, had calmed down.  "}
{"text": "There was a wide garden between the ballroom and the dormitory. Moreover, it was a spring night.  The newly bloomed magnolias were drooping by their heavy heads.

{"text": "our toes.  “My goodness.”  The Heretic Questioner stepped on a fallen magnolia petal.  "}
{"text": "“Ah.”  He stopped and looked up at the night sky. After a while, the Heretic Questioner turned his head and  looked at me. His face was impassive. He seemed to be disoriented.  "}

{"text": "“When I say [when spring comes], you, the Heretic Questioner, will reply [magnolia falls]. That’s our  passcode. It’s the phrase that tells us to get a hold of ourselves. Now, if you understand, tell me. When  spring comes?”  "}
{"text": "“Magnolia......  “Again. When spring comes.”  “Magnolias fall.”  "}
{"text": "Little by little, the eyes of the Heretic Questioner showed that he was returning to himself. He started to  look in front of him, rather than blankly into space. The Heretic Questioner shook his head, saying,  “Hmm,” and “Well!” Then, he nodded.  "}
{"text": "“Yes! I’m back!”  “Okay. Good job.”  “Thank you, Death King! Aha. Indeed, today had a storm of surprises. I’ll never forget this day.”  "}
{"text": "“Would you like to rest and have a cup of tea?”  “Please!”  "}
{"text": "Good. It wasn’t over yet. It was too early to give up this round.  I handed the Heretic Questioner a blanket and headed to the kitchen. Because it was a dormitory of the  academy where royalty and nobles attend, there was a small kitchen in the Lady of the Golden Silk’s  "}

{"text": "“My body just moves on its own....”  I never really made tea other than the ones in tea bags. It had been like that my whole life, but my  hands moved automatically as if I had steeped tea for years. It was a side effect of the immersion.  "}
{"text": "My body was even feeling [joy] by making tea.  “The lady likes it best when I add milk and a spoonful of honey.’  I was humming.  "}

{"text": "I clenched my teeth.  ‘No way. I’ve worked too hard to clear the stages so far!’  I was determined.  "}
{"text": "Even if I made tea, I wouldn’t make it like the original character. I used a kettle that he didn’t normally  use and pulled out a different teacup from usual. Like that, I gave the tea to the Heretic Questioner.  "}
{"text": "“Death King.”  The Heretic Questioner took a few sips and tilted his head.  "}
{"text": "“Yes.”  “The tea tastes weird!”  "}
{"text": "“So what?”  “If my taste buds are working correctly, this iffy taste is salt, right?”  “That’s just how this tea tastes.”  "}
{"text": "“Oho. Rather than tea, isn’t this more like saltwater? If you just measure the salinity, I think it’ll be  judged simply as saltwater, nothing more, nothing less.”  "}
{"text": "“Just shut up and drink.”  “Understood! I’1l shut up and drink!”  The Heretic Questioner slurped up the tea.  "}
{"text": "“Thank you for the tea! It was salty!”  The Heretic Questioner smiled broadly. Yup. This was how things should be. Our natural psycho finally  regained his guilelessness.  "}
{"text": "“So, what do you think we should do from now?”  “We have to make sure the villainess and the prince  stay together.”  "}
{"text": "I sighed.  “Or at least crush the [love line] between the Lady of the Golden Silk and the crown prince into  "}

{"text": "The Heretic Questioner chose the name of the operation on his own.  Well, it didn’t matter. I also preferred the second ending.  I had never dated before, so I didn’t know much, but—  "}
{"text": "“Wouldn’t it be much easier to break something than making it?’  It would be difficult to matchmake the crown prince and the Lady of the Silver Lily, but it would be  easy to have the Lady of the Golden Silk break up with him.  "}
{"text": "In this part, the Heretic Questioner and I were 100% on the same page.  "}
{"text": "“To do that, the prince’s love for the Lady of the Golden Silk must become cold! Do you have any  plans?”  “I do.”  "}
{"text": "I realized something when I was losing my mind while making tea. We need to take special measures  for this stage.  "}
{"text": "“There is a way.’  Not only would it reduce the prince’s affection for the protagonist, but it would also be very effective in  "}
{"text": "allowing the two of us, especially me, to keep our consciousness.  “What’s the plan?”  "}
{"text": "“Tn the end, the more you act like [The Lady of the Golden Silk] and the more I act like a [butler], the  more immersed we become in the roles.”  "}
{"text": "So flipping that thought...  “Then what if you do [something the Lady of the Golden Silk would never do] and [something the  butler would never do]?”  "}
{"text": "“The character immersion rate may drop. Even if it doesn’t fall, it won’t go up. How does that sound?”  The Heretic Questioner’s eyes shone.  "}
{"text": "ee Ooh. Indeed. It’s a simple yet good method. As expected of Death King! You’re the Hunter who  broke through the unyielding 10th floor and cleared the 20th floor!”  "}
{"text": "“You flatter me. Mm. Anyway, our conclusion is simple.”  I flicked my hand and triggered a skill.  “From now on, let’s become a [bad girl] and a [bad butler].”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner tilted his head.  “What?”  "}
{"text": "The Hundred Ghosts Reincarnation activated. I didn’t have to bring in a lot of spirits like I did in the  Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon. We only needed one specific ghost.  My shadow wriggled and took on the shape of a person.  "}

{"text": "“Yes, and you’ll be taught. It’s a 1-on-1 last-minute tutoring session.”  I slowly looked at Yoo Sooha.  “The greatest tutor will teach you how to be a bad person.”  "}
{"text": "“Aha. I’m looking forward to it!”  “Mmph—, mmph!! Mmm mmph!”  "}

{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily and the crown prince. Both of them were dangerous. Merely being close to  them deepened our immersions. The Heretic Questioner became closer to the Lady of the Golden Silk,  and I became closer to the butler.  "}

{"text": "I whispered in a voice that would only be heard by the Heretic Questioner.  “Did it rise?”  “Yes. It went up a little.”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner whispered back, “My immersion rate is now 17 percent. Aha, it rose one  percent when the prince spoke to me. It rose another one percent when I saw the Lady of the Silver  Lily. In total, it’s 2 percent higher than yesterday.”  "}
{"text": "2%.  "}
{"text": "Compared to last night’s insane increase, the immersion speed had definitely slowed down. Should we  take the risk now and enter the tiger’s den? If not now, when would be better?  I met the Heretic Questioner’s eyes.  "}

{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily frowned. Then, she lightly turned around.  “Follow me quietly.”  "}
{"text": "4.  The place she led us to was her own lodgings. The Lady of the Silver Lily, whose family had great  "}

{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily’s accommodations were fancier than the other students’, but that was all.  The prince was someone raised in the imperial palace. He didn’t seem impressed by the luxury.  "}
{"text": "“Do you think I would do that?”  The Lady of the Silver Lily kept walking, unaffected by his words. Click. Click. The lady’s shoes made  a noise whenever they hit the hallway.  "}
{"text": "“The walk was an excuse.”  “What?”  "}
{"text": "“There were many eyes in the garden. I couldn’t tell you the truth like that. It must remain a secret.”  “...A secret?”  “Yes.”  "}

{"text": "subordinates had evil intentions.”  The villa of the duke’s daughter had a staircase that led to the basement. Standing in front of it, the  Lady of the Silver Lily looked back at us.  "}
{"text": "Her face was expressionless.  “Shall we go down, Your Highness?”  "}
{"text": "Sree I don’t see the servants. How bizarre. Where did the duchy’s servants go?”  “Are you worried? I suppose you must be. I will take the lead.”  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily went down the stairs without answering the prince’s question. Her clicking  footsteps seeped through the basement. Click. Click.... Soon, the darkness of the stairs buried the Lady  of the Silver Lily.  "}
{"text": "The prince gulped and started going down the stairs.  The Heretic Questioner and I also followed them.  "}
{"text": "Something thickened in the air as we went down the stairs. It was something that my nose and my life  were becoming too used to. The scent of blood. The Heretic Questioner and I weren’t flustered, but the  prince’s shoulders ahead of us flinched.  "}
{"text": "“—] apologize for bringing you to such a squalid place, Your Highness.”  In the basement, three human beings were tied down in chairs.  "}
{"text": "All three were the duchy’s servants whom I saw last night, and—  “These are the people behind the assassins who attacked the Lady of the Golden Silk.”  All three were soaked in blood.  "}
{"text": "The prince’s hands trembled.  Even I frowned a little. The only ones whose expressions did not change after descending the stairs  were the Heretic Questioner and the Lady of the Silver Lily.  "}
{"text": "It was understandable why the Heretic Questioner was unaffected. He was the guild master of the Ten  Thousand Temple, which carried out uncountable numbers of torture and interrogations in the Tower.  "}
{"text": "However, the other person was just a duke’s daughter. She resembled the moonlight. Staggering and  swaying like she would fall any moment, she appeared fragile. That girl stood here as if she was very  familiar with these types of places.  "}
{"text": "“This is the result of the investigation I did overnight.”  Then, I remembered.  "}
{"text": "“Tt turned out that they had done it for personal revenge.”  The lady in front of me was the person who would destroy the world.  “Personal... revenge?”  "}
{"text": "“Yes. Would you like to hear about it?”  The Lady of the Silver Lily grabbed a servant by his hair. “Aghh!” The servant opened his eye in  agony. Could he not open his right eye? He looked at us with only his left.  "}
{"text": "“His Highness the Prince has honored us with a visit. Pay respect.”  "}
{"text": "“Milady, euk...... Miladyyy...... ‘  “You and your colleagues ordered an assassination. The target was the Lady of the Golden Silk.  Explain to the prince why you attempted to kill the lady.”  "}

{"text": "This was a false testimony.  “Yes... That’s right, milady... That’s right....”  "}
{"text": "It was to protect the prince.  “Are you certain?”  “There’s no mistake......  “All right. I see.”  "}
{"text": "To protect the prince of this country, the Lady of the Silver Lily deliberately brought about a [false  testimony].  "}
{"text": "She must have ensured the three of them would say the same thing, concocted an alibi, and perfectly  manipulated all evidence.  "}
{"text": "These people would never be able to reveal the fact that they were [the prince’s agents].  The prince’s act of confining the Heretic Questioner and me in the warehouse was moved [behind the  scenes].  "}
{"text": "So was his attempt to intervene and [pretend to be a hero] during the crisis.  The Lady of the Silver Lily was trying to bury all truth in the ground.  "}
{"text": "For none other than the crown prince.  For the man who would be affected the most if the truth were revealed.  "}
{"text": "“Your Highness.”  The Lady of the Silver Lily lifted her head and looked at the prince.  “Please punish them.”  "}
{"text": "The prince flinched.  “What do you mean, punish...... ae  "}
{"text": "“These are the men who tried to kill the Lady of the Golden Silk, whom Your Highness cares about.  They are criminals who invaded the cradle of nobility. They deserve to be punished, and you can  punish them. Your Highness is currently the foundation of this country.”  "}
{"text": "“Why do you hesitate?”  The Lady of the Silver Lady asked,  “Ts there perhaps a different truth to this case than what I have discovered?”  "}
{"text": "“T tell you this not as a student of the academy but as someone who will be Your Highness’s vassal.  Your Highness, the foundation of the country. If you find my investigation to be insufficient, please  push the punishment onto another. As this matter is serious, I will send notice to the emperor’s special  operatives.”  "}
{"text": "The emperor’s special operatives.  As soon as I heard that, a memory of the ‘butler’ was revived.  "}
{"text": "They were hunting dogs under the control of one person and did not answer to anyone else. Made up of  the empire’s top swordsmen and magicians, they were given absolute rights over independent  investigation.  "}
{"text": "The reason why this prince was able to take over as the crown prince was because they swallowed up  the former crown prince, who had been corrupt.  “However, if you are satisfied with this investigation, there is no need for such troublesome work.”  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily bowed her back.  On the basement floor, there was a sword that seemed to have been prepared in advance.  “In this place, please punish—”  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily rolled up her sleeves like she was familiar with the movement.  Both her arms had numerous scars marking her skin.  "}
{"text": "“—the one who didn’t properly manage the servants of her family—”  Wounds from stabs, cuts, scratches, pulls, flogs, and torture took space on every part of her arms, which  "}

{"text": "The prince laughed weakly.  "}
{"text": "No, could we even say that was a laugh? The tip of his mouth just lifted slightly and trembled. It was a  gruesome failure of a smile.  He turned his head like he was escaping and looked at the Heretic Questioner and me. His eyes asked,  "}

{"text": "“Sylvia...”  The prince helplessly let the tip of the sword point down. He looked at us blankly. Did he want one of  us to come forward and stop the Lady of the Silver Lily?  "}
{"text": "“What a neat resolution!”  However, the Heretic Questioner laughed brightly.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s neat how you brought in the two of us in addition to the crown prince. Aha. So everyone here will  become [accomplices] and keep their mouths shut by your calculations.

{"text": "“In any case, the Lady of the Silver Lily wishes to make us accomplices. That’s why she brought us  here.... And His Highness seems to be unable to carry out the punishment alone. I believe that it will be  appropriate to divide the punishment equally.”  "}
{"text": "There was a hush for a while.  “Hmm.”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner closed an eye.  The Lady of the Silver Lily pinched her brows without a word.  The crown prince’s complexion quickly brightened.  "}

{"text": "“T know her.”  -Well, when you’re in a relationship, you have to be very aware of your partner. That’s how to be a  man. But right now, you’re her exclusive servant. Even if you don’t do anything, you will have more  "}

{"text": "“You can think of it as your reward for showing me something special.”  In this darkness, the Lady of the Silver Lily led the way with her lantern.  I followed after her, being careful not to step on her shadow.  "}
{"text": "“For that, I will tell you my secret.”  The Lady of the Silver Lily was wearing her nightdress. The white dress was loose over her form. My  heart jumped every time the hem of her dress fluttered. Was this because I’d gone nuts, like Bae Hu-  "}
{"text": "ryeong said? But wasn’t this feeling too tender to say it was nuts?  “Follow me.”  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily walked forward. At night, nobody was in the hallway. As I followed her, I  stared openly at her fingers, lit up by the lantern’s light.  "}
{"text": "“What are you thinking right now?” the Lady of the Silver Lily asked suddenly.  “What?”  “T asked what you’re thinking about. I can feel your gaze. I’m curious.”  "}
{"text": "“Although it is only temporary, you are my servant. Is it not disloyal to refuse to answer your master’s  question? I said I’m curious, so you have to answer.”  I hesitated.  "}

{"text": "Her skin. Her touch. The cool temperature. The moment her dry fingers wrapped around mine, I almost  mistook them to be gripping around my heart. A flower scent thickened inside my head.  "}

{"text": "[Shiny is shaking to bring back the warrior’s senses. ]  A Constellation’s warning.  "}
{"text": "The reaction of these two, this languid addiction I felt, all made me feel some déja vu.  It was the same sensation I felt in the basement, when the Lady of the Silver Lily interrogated her  servants.  "}
{"text": "This intuition that it was dangerous.  "}
{"text": "“Hmm?”  The Lady of the Silver Lily looked at me. Her red eyes, her expressionless face, placidly looked at me.  “What’s wrong?”  "}

{"text": "“You just need to say it once.”  Just one time...  "}
{"text": "If it was just once, wouldn’t it be all right? To test it out?  I did feel the danger, but if something went wrong, I had the power to turn back time. That’s right... I  have that sort of power. So it wasn’t wrong to say that I also had the power to take risks. If you thought  "}
{"text": "about it, this might have been the right thing to do. Wasn’t it important to know what would happen if  that word came from my mouth? Wasn’t this somewhat similar to when there was the traitor among the  Rankers when we first dealt with the Devil King of Fall Rain?  "}
{"text": "So, wouldn’t it be okay? Saying just one word. If things went wrong, I just had to turn back time. It  would end just like that since I had that ability.  Then, just once, at least once, I could...  "}

{"text": "Thus, I ran away with the Alchemist in the snowfield, so I would not take a single death for granted.  “ ... apologize, milady.”  I put my palm on the back of the Lady of the Silver Lily’s hand. Though it was only a word.  "}
{"text": "Because it was only a word.  “Why are you apologizing?”  “T cannot recognize you as my true master.”  "}
{"text": "I wanted to learn the joy of love. I was learning it. But even then, I didn’t want to learn to the extent  that I lost myself. At least, not for a one-sided relationship.  "}

{"text": "to live.”  I gripped the Lady of the Silver Lily’s hand a little more strongly.  “If you want to see me go mad, please go mad with me.”  "}
{"text": "Then, the Lady of the Silver Lily shook off my hand. She took two steps back like someone who was  dealt an unexpected blow.  "}
{"text": "“.. Indeed.”  However, her poker face had not yet collapsed.  "}
{"text": "“You’re different from the other half-baked apostles. I thought you were a docile child... But being  unfamiliar with love does not mean you are unfamiliar to life. I was in too much of a hurry.”  "}
{"text": "“You tried to tempt me to become your subordinate, right?”  “Tt was my mistake. I thought you were easy.”  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily bit her lips for a moment. Even her face was beautiful and terrifying. In the  hallway at night, the white moonlight that shined on her became a shadow.  “Yes, I’m not an easy man to win.”  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s a shame. It would have been comfortable if you dedicated everything to me.”  “You said that understanding is no different than taking responsibility. One-sided responsibility is only  one-sided understanding. I didn’t come to Your Ladyship because I wanted something like that.”  "}
{"text": "My heart was pounding, but I endured it.  “So, what is the secret you planned to tell me?”  The Lady of the Silver Lily turned around and began to walk.  "}
{"text": "“_.. There is a heirloom in my family that has been passed down from long ago. It is a sword with a  laughable legend attached to it. If you make a wish, the sword will surely make it come true.”  "}
{"text": "At the end of the hallway.  Curtains were placed where even the moonlight could not reach. The curtains were thick and red, and  "}
{"text": "they seemed to be covering something.  “However, there are conditions.”  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily grabbed the tail of the curtain. With a whoosh, the curtains were pulled  aside. Beyond the veil, there was a full-length mirror that looked like it belonged in a dressing room.  "}
{"text": "And.  “When you make your wish, you must stab your heart with the sword.”  A sword was embedded in the center of the mirror.  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily stood before the mirror.  Coincidentally, the heart of the lady was reflected over where the blade was stuck.  [Shiny detects the presence of her sister. ]  "}
{"text": "The Holy Sword by my waist trembled.  [Shiny says that this is the Guardian Sword’s third sister. ]  "}
{"text": "Drip. Drip.  Blood came out of the mirror from the sword, drop by drop. The curtains that had been hiding the  "}

{"text": "“Back when I was not yet a regressor, His Majesty the Prince became infatuated with the Lady of the  Golden Silk. I was resentful, and I made a wish to my family’s sword.”  "}
{"text": "“What was your wish...?”  The Lady of the Silver Lily’s lips moved.  -Please let my love last forever.  "}
{"text": "“Then, my life became eternal.”  “Even if I die, I do not die. My feelings for His Majesty also remain unchanged. My heart has become  immovable since that day.”  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily took my hand.  She grabbed my hand and led it to her chest.  "}
{"text": "Where her heart was. Where it should have been.  “Did you say you wanted my heart?”  "}
{"text": "But.  I couldn’t feel a heartbeat there.  “T’m sorry,” said the Lady of the Silver Lily. “I have no heart to give you.”  "}
{"text": "[The silver-plated heart is looking at you.]  And the blood flowing from the mirror gathered and began to form a small shape.  The size was different, but it was definitely the thing that killed the Crusader and the Count last time.  "}
{"text": "It was the shape of a demon.  I didn’t know why the blood from the mirror made that shape, whether it had been summoned or  created.  "}
{"text": "“Now.”  However, the Lady of the Silver Lily raised the sword like she was used to it.  "}
{"text": "“Help me.”  The sword was pointed at the little demon.  “Tt’s time to take care of today’s tasks.”  "}

{"text": "A single drop swelled into a single column.  One column split into six.  The corridor was covered in blood.  "}
{"text": "It was a sea of red blood.  The grandfather clock rang its last.  We were standing on a carpet of blood.  "}
{"text": "“Milady.”  I instinctively wrapped myself around the shoulders of the Lady of the Silver Lily. The pool of blood  swarmed all the way up to our ankles. The slimey, moist texture felt foreboding.  "}

{"text": "-You wiped my tears with your sleeves. You were still a nice person.  -The heart was soft. That’s why.  -But...  "}
{"text": "Stab!  The Lady of the Silver Lily pierced the blood bubble lips with her rapier. The demon popped. However,  twice or thrice as many tongues arose from the sea of blood in its place.  "}

{"text": "I also swung my sword.  -What’s the point of loving someone who was born distinguished ?  "}

{"text": "-Disgusting.  The sea of blood surged with laughter.  "}

{"text": "Those demons were the familiars of the Lady of the Silver Lily.  [The presence of the silver-plated heart becomes more prominent. |  Something other than lips came from the sea of blood.  "}

{"text": "Anger toward the crown prince. Contempt.  The fact that an honorable person like the Lady of the Silver Lily was hurt because of such a man, that  she had made an irreversible wish. These things made me mad.  "}

{"text": "-Hmm.  Bae Hu-ryeong clasped his chin.  "}
{"text": "-It’s not a typical ascension. In Murim terms, it isn’t a righteous path but an evil path. Though the  sword in the mirror is only a fragment, it was once a part of the [Guardian Goddess].  Bae Hu-ryeong shrugged and muttered.  "}
{"text": "-If you embed it in your heart, you’Il ascend to a Constellation even if you don’t want to... Combined  with the repeated regression, it isn’t something a human body can handle. Though, she isn’t a complete  Constellation but a knockoff. Anyway, it was the result of many coincidences.  "}

{"text": "-The important part is the conditions. Not will. There are many people who suffer because they are  human, but those who suffer because they became Constellations are also surprisingly common. It’s  easy for one’s life to become miserable. Understand, Young Master of the Demonic Sect?  "}
{"text": "I exhaled.  My anger toward the prince fermented in my heart. That anger left a bitter taste in my mouth.  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily looked at me.  “How unusual. Aren’t you disappointed?”  “Excuse me?”  "}
{"text": "“Your words are correct. Whatever the circumstances, those demons are my familiars. They aren’t  making up the verses. The things they said were all things I whispered in my dreams, even if it was  unconsciously.”  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily tilted her head.  "}
{"text": "“T pledged a love that would never change. In order to keep that love pure, I have to remove the dust  and flaws that settle in my love everyday.”  Disappointment.  "}

{"text": "An oil stain on a heart.  The very epitome of a curse.  "}
{"text": "“Isn’t it ugly?” muttered the Lady of the Silver Lily. “I have shown you what love is. But I didn’t only  show you. I tried to harvest your love, too. I brought you here to awaken you from this fantasy.”  "}
{"text": "“Disappointed?”  Without my knowledge, a breath spilled from my lips. It wasn’t a sigh. It was a breath barely  containing anger.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s ugly? I don’t know much, but milady, I will never be disappointed in you about something like  this.”  "}
{"text": "“.. Like this?”  “You told me a secret. You took your heart and revealed it to me as it is. A person who is really  "}

{"text": "“Rather, I’m worse. If Your Ladyship knew what kind of thoughts I have, you would abhor me.”  “That makes me curious.”  "}
{"text": "“If you brought me here to make me give up, you were wrong, milady. I didn’t fall in love with you  because your heart isn’t ugly.”  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily paused very briefly. Love. It was because of this word. My face became hot  when I said it out loud, but I didn’t think to hesitate.  “Tt’s only been one day since you came to love me. My teaching is brilliant.”  "}
{"text": "“Does it matter that it’s only been a day? Would it have been better if I loved you for a year? A  thousand days? Do you want me to return after that?”  "}
{"text": "“T can see what kind of people you despise. And what you despise is the same as what I hate. I can see  what scars you wear and how you are hurt. I love the way you live. Because, you and I, we live the  same life.”  "}
{"text": "Will she hear me? Would she understand what I mean?  That wasn’t something I could know.  "}
{"text": "I had never said something like this to anyone else. I wasn’t used to it. But I wanted to keep the person  in front of me. And I wanted the Lady of the Silver Lily to keep me. I wanted us to share one life and  have each other.  "}
{"text": "“T love you as much as I love myself. I wish you could love me as much as I love you.”  These were my true feelings.  And the only method I knew was to exclaim it with all my heart.  "}
{"text": "“T will definitely make you love me. I won’t tell you to abandon the crown prince. Even if I don’t ask  you to, you will abandon him one day.”  “My heart is...”  "}
{"text": "“Yes. But it doesn’t matter if your heart is held hostage by the world. If that’s the problem, I’ll free you.  But if you still love the crown prince, then I’1l become an even better person than he is and stay by your  side.”  "}
{"text": "“Did the crown prince give you unforgettable memories when you were children? That doesn’t matter,  either.”  "}
{"text": "I whispered in the Lady of the Silver Lily’s ear.  “The two of us are regressors. The only two in the world.”  I knew that my face was red. But I said what I had to say.  "}
{"text": "“There will be a lot of times that only you and I can enjoy. During those times, I’ll give you such  breathtaking memories that they will make your memory of the prince fade away. I'll try my best.”  "}
{"text": "“Hmm.”  The tips of the Lady of the Silver Lily’s eyes rose up.  “Can you repeat these last ten days indefinitely? You’ll become tired of it.”  "}
{"text": "“That’s no issue. This isn’t the first time I’ve repeated the same days over and over again.”  “What if I tell you to get out of my sight because I become tired of you?”  “T’ll disappear, but—”  "}
{"text": "I moved my hand. I moved it, and I grabbed the Lady of the Silver Lily’s fingertips. She had let go of  her lantern while fighting the demons. It was something that took courage. A lot of it. Fortunately, I had  enough.  "}
{"text": "“To start with, that’s not going to happen.”  “Why is that?”  "}
{"text": "“Because you haven’t grown tired of the crown prince... and I am a better person than he is. If I make  you uncomfortable, please tell me now. I’ll disappear.”  "}
{"text": "Silence.  The Lady of the Silver Lily looked at my face.  “_.. You’re insufferable.”  "}

{"text": "It was then.  “ |!”  "}
{"text": "...ler...!  "}
{"text": "From far down the corridor, there was a voice. It sounded urgent. The Lady of the Silver Lily’s servants  must have been asleep, yet the residence suddenly was disturbed.  “ ..where...! But...!”  "}
{"text": "Soon, we heard footsteps. The servants had woken up. Lights turned on everywhere, and shortly after,  the gray-haired servant ran to where the two of us stood.  "}
{"text": "“T apologize, milady.”  The Lady of the Silver Lily let go of my hand.  "}

{"text": "“The gatecrasher is none other than she.”  Her tone clearly revealed her contempt for the Heretic Questioner—no, the Lady of the Golden Silk.  “Seeing that she’s here at this hour, she hasn’t come for tea. Butler, was this visit planned?”  "}
{"text": "“Tt was not.”  I was also disconcerted. Wasn’t it past midnight already? The Heretic Questioner had no reason to meet  the Lady of the Silver Lily at this time.  "}
{"text": "He and I had talked two days ago.  "}
{"text": "[For now, I’ll work as the Lady of the Silver Lily’s personal butler], I had said. [It’s to get information  about her and about how to beat this stage. ]  |Hmm. |  "}

{"text": "At least, I thought we did.  “Bring forth my butler!”  "}
{"text": "The voice became closer as we walked.  “Butler! I know you’re here!”  The garden of the Lady of the Silver Lily’s quarters.  "}
{"text": "Even the dark sky of the night could not cover the springtime in the flower garden. The mature white  magnolias’ heads drooped, overwhelmed by the weight of the season. The moon was red, and the  moonlight reflected off the magnolia petals were ruddy. Thus, the white magnolias of the garden looked  like pink magnolias in full bloom.  "}
{"text": "“Ah! ”  A magnolia petal fell.  “As I thought, you were here, butler!”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner pushed aside the guard at the gate. The guards were hesitating as they could not  recklessly hurt the daughter of a baron.  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner took the moment to hoist up her skirt and stride into the garden. Squish. The  pink magnolia petal that had fallen earlier was trampled under the Heretic Questioner’s shoe.  "}
{"text": "“T was worried when you didn’t come back.”  “Really. Making your master worry and search for you personally... Doesn’t that disqualify you as a  servant?”  "}
{"text": "I had a bad feeling as soon as I saw the Heretic Questioner.  The hair.  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner’s moonlit blond hair was longer than it was the previous day.  “Milady...”  "}
{"text": "“You are my one and only butler and childhood friend. You mean more to me than any ordinary  servant. Is it too undignified for me to ask that you recognize this fact?”  It wasn’t just his hair. Face. Appearance. Even though traces of the Heretic Questioner remained, his  "}
{"text": "appearance was somehow unfamiliar.  ‘Did he change his appearance with the sacred techniques?’  Why?  "}
{"text": "“In any case, you shouldn’t be at a place like this. I feel like even the flower garden is poisonous. Now!  Butler, come here and let’s go back together.”  "}
{"text": "“Tmpertinent woman.”  When the Heretic Questioner tried to approach me, the Lady of the Silver Lily stood in her way.  "}
{"text": "“This sort of disturbance at nighttime is a felony that should be punished with a lashing. Where do you  think you are to raise your voice like so? Get down on your knees and admit your errors, immediately.”  "}
{"text": "“Oh? Are you going cane me?”  The Heretic Questioner grinned.  "}
{"text": "“If you’re going to hit me, please hit me firmly and with strength. Your Ladyship, I wonder what will  happen if I show the scars you leave on my calves to His Highness the Prince. The memories shared by  the prince and I will increase again.”  "}
{"text": "“D-disgusting...!”  The ducal servants shuddered. The crown prince’s official fiancée was the Lady of the Silver Lily. Yet,  this upstart spoke of showing her calves to the lady’s fiancé and making memories right in front of her.  "}
{"text": "The servants’ faces turned red, and they glared at the Heretic Questioner.  The Lady of the Silver Lily quietly whispered, “Really?”  Flinch. The servants froze when they heard her voice.  "}
{"text": "My chest chilled in an instant, as well.  “Then, I shall do so.”  "}
{"text": "That was just how cold the Lady of the Silver Lily’s voice was.  “Your desire to make beautiful memories during your school days is lovely. Indeed, if it’s you, you can  even lionize a memory of rolling in a dung field. If you want to make some wonderful memories, I, as a  "}

{"text": "‘js the crown prince the type of person who would do that?’  Nobody could voice their protests.  “My left hand is still empty.”  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily’s voice flowed.  “Bring a cane. I will not repeat myself.”  "}
{"text": "Her servants’ shoes busily moved on the road where the pink magnolias fell to retrieve a cane from the  building.  "}
{"text": "They bowed their heads as if they were afraid of showing their faces in the moonlight. Only two  people, the Lady of the Silver Lily and the Heretic Questioner, kept their heads high.  “Milady.”  "}
{"text": "Eventually, I had no choice but to get closer to the Heretic Questioner.  “What’s wrong? Why did you come here at a time like this?”  “T came to get back what is mine. You’re making me state the obvious.”  "}

{"text": "The Heretic Questioner’s smile was bright, as always.  “T won’t let her take anything from me, whether it’s the prince’s favor or your allegiance. A cane? She  can hit me as much as she wants. I came for you, butler. She’s the one who will be hurt more the more  "}
{"text": "she whips me.”  “No... Sorry. Just a moment. Please excuse me.”  "}

{"text": "“Milady.”  “Yes.”  I gulped and whispered,  "}
{"text": "“Heretic Questioner.”  There was silence.  “What?”  "}
{"text": "My heart was pounding.  "}
{"text": "My lips were dry. My tongue couldn’t move. Was it always so difficult to articulate words one by one  to weave a sentence? Slowly, I opened my mouth.  “When spring comes.”  "}
{"text": "“Pardon?”  My heart.  "}
{"text": "“Heretic Questioner...”  “What are you talking about, butler?”  "}
{"text": "“If you’re playing around like last time, I really will get mad. I mean it. I’m asking seriously right now.  Please answer me properly. How high is your immersion rate?”  The Heretic Questioner blinked.  "}
{"text": "“Hmm? Butler, are you playing around? Were you thinking of old times? Or was your head messed up  from being with Her Ladyship for a day? Oh, butler. With gentle tolerance, I understand.”  "}
{"text": "“When spring comes...”  “Tt has.”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner laughed.  “Spring has already come, butler.”  No,  "}
{"text": "“Isn’t it a beautiful season?”  It was the Lady of the Golden Silk who laughed.  “T-I brought what you wanted...”  "}
{"text": "The servants who had scattered to the building returned. Heads bowed, they offered the cane to the  Lady of the SIlver Lily.  "}
{"text": "It was thin.  I guessed that they must have been struggling to find the most slender cane in the mansion. Was that  "}
{"text": "their way of caring for their master?  “Find another one.”  However, the Lady of the Silver Lily was heartless. The servants flinched and turned back.  "}
{"text": "“Find another one.”  This order was repeated four times. Each time, the cane became thicker. The servant bit his lip and held  out the fourth cane. The Lady of the Silver Lily held it in her left hand.  "}

{"text": "“Tt is my crime to dare to be born to a baron family from the countryside and to be loved by the crown  prince.”  "}
{"text": "That—that wasn’t something one should have said in front of the prince’s fiancée.  “T apologize for being loved.”  "}
{"text": "The baron’s daughter gently held the hems of her skirt. She sank on top of the magnolia-filled garden  and bowed her head to the lily standing before her.  Her mannerism was flawless.  "}
{"text": "“T am sorry for receiving more love than Miss Raviel Ivansia.”  “Is this apology enough?”  The wind blew.  "}
{"text": "“By the way, Miss Raviel Ivansia. I’m curious. Is this really my crime? Love is only meaningful when  it is received. It is shared between the one who loves and the one who receives it, so is it solely my  responsibility? Perhaps...”  "}
{"text": "No words followed that ‘perhaps.’ Instead, she laughed. A petal hanging onto a black branch fell.  The Lady of the Silver Lily quietly raised her left hand.  “You dreadful thing.”  "}
{"text": "The cane tore through the night air.  "}

{"text": "When the sky was covered with the dust on the moon, when humans bled on the ground, it turned red.  Cough. The thick air caused the Lady of the Silver Lily to cough. Her cough sounded coarse.  "}
{"text": "No one spoke.  Only the whistle of the cane and the sound of coughing filled the garden in the night.  “Sylvia!”  "}
{"text": "A torch light swayed.  “Sylvia! Are you there, Sylvia?”  "}
{"text": "The sound of footsteps broke the silence. Beyond the gate, the crown prince was running, holding a  torch. The guards scrambled to him. With an uproar like this, there was no way the prince wouldn’t find  out.  "}
{"text": "“Syl...”  The prince stopped in front of the gate.  "}
{"text": "Looking into the garden, he fell silent for a moment.  “Raviel...!!”  His tone was different from when he called out to the Lady of the Golden Silk.  "}
{"text": "“Step aside!”  The prince pushed the ducal guards away. There were none among them who would block the path of  the nation’s foundation. The prince ran straight to the side of the Lady of the Golden Silk’s side.  "}
{"text": "“How, no matter how much she... How...!”  “I’m fine, Your Highness.”  "}
{"text": "“I’m not fine! Like a fool...!”  The prince looked over the Lady of the Golden Silk.  "}
{"text": "Then, he turned his head to stare at the Lady of the Silver Lily.  “You spiteful woman!”  "}
{"text": "Words become scars.  “How could you treat Sylvia so cruelly?!”  "}
{"text": "Those who inflict the pain do not know it because they cannot see the scars.  “Tt is the law of the empire, Your Highness.”  “Is the law more important than the people?”  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s more important than an individual.”  “That’s why I say that you’re spiteful! You’re like a witch!”  "}
{"text": "The world was probably divided into those who knew and those who did not. The prince fell into the  latter group.  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily coughed and sighed.  “Are you going to punish me?”  The prince’s face grimaced. Just grimaced. He could not answer the Lady of the Silver Lily’s question.  "}
{"text": "He shook his head as if she didn’t deserve an answer, but he was just avoiding it.  The prince didn’t have the guts to take responsibility for the Lady of the Silver Lily nor the skills to  deal with her.  "}

{"text": "“The whole empire will become rowdy starting tomorrow,” the Lady of the Silver Lily said calmly as  we stormed out of the academy.  "}
{"text": "“Will it?”  “Tt’s because I’m well-known.”  We were riding in a carriage that belonged to the Lady of the Silver Lily. Her Ladyship had said, ‘Since  "}
{"text": "I decided to live recklessly for a change, I want to leave the academy,’ and I, of course, had no reason  to object.  “To start with, around 200 letters from the social circles in the capital will come pouring out. Twenty  "}

{"text": "I was about to speak when I paused. Wait a moment. Did Her Ladyship call me [Gongja] instead of  [butler]? This was the first time she called me by my name.  "}
{"text": "“What’s wrong?”  The Lady of the Silver Lily looked up.  “Your face is red. Gongja, have you caught a cold?”  "}
{"text": "“The nights are cold in the spring. Gongja. Even if your body temperature runs high, you must be  cautious. So, won’t you quickly answer my question, Gongja?”  "}
{"text": "Uh.  I had to counter, even if it’s just a little.  “W-when did you write your request for withdrawal? You wrote it in secret when I wasn’t around, even  "}
{"text": "though we’re going to repeat this day. Wow. That’s a little cute.”  “Cute, Gongja? Did you think I’d be flustered if you called me cute? Gongja, were you trying to  counterattack? Now, that’s cute. Did you want me to call you cute, Gongja?”  "}
{"text": "“T’]l take that as your surrender.”  Today as well, milady won.  "}
{"text": "This was my future now. On the other hand, wasn’t I the winner if my future involved being beaten by  Her Ladyship? That thought ended me.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s small,” the Lady of the Silver Lily said suddenly. She was staring through the window at  Sormwyn Academy, which was becoming smaller and smaller.  “Sormwyn Academy was established to strengthen the empire’s power. Children of nobility and  "}

{"text": "“T’ve been there for too long,” murmured the Lady of the Silver Lily. “Past that small gate lurks  jealousy, vanity, arrogance, exclusivity, love, lust—everything, barely hidden under the name of  tradition and order.

{"text": "“If you break my heart, I’Il kill you.”  My neck felt cold.  "}
{"text": "“Do you understand?”  “Yes, I understand.”  “Tell me what you understand.”  "}
{"text": "“Never. No matter what happens. I won’t scar your spirit. If I ever hurt you because of genuine  ignorance, I’ll apologize.”  "}
{"text": "“You need to understand it a little better.”  The Lady of the Silver Lily stood up and sat beside me.  Squeeze.  "}
{"text": "She placed her palm on the back of my hand. My heart jumped, but the back of my neck was still cold.  The one I fell in love with had fire in her eyes and ice in her voice.  "}
{"text": "“Tf you ever betray me, Gongja.”  “Yes.”  “T’]l make you strangle me with your own hands. Don’t use aura or anything like it. Only use your own  "}
{"text": "hands to kill. Kill me again and again until this world where you and I have met is erased. It doesn’t  matter if it takes hundreds or thousands of days.

{"text": "In the center of her neck, I could feel her icy vocal folds.  “And live forever remembering that I will never forgive you.”  “Tf it’s you, you can live forever. If that’s what you want.”  "}
{"text": "I gulped.  “Yes.”  "}
{"text": "“Know that the moment you betray me, you will be banished to an eternal hell.”  The Lady of the Silver Lily whispered, “Do you understand?”  "}
{"text": "I opened my mouth.  “T understand, Raviel.”  “If you have any secrets to tell me, confess them now.”  "}
{"text": "“T have a skill called the Hundred Ghosts Reincarnation.”  I confessed without any hesitation.  "}
{"text": "“Someone who dies by my hand can be summoned by me after their death. The summoned person may  not have the powers they did in life, but if I want them to, they’I!l inherit their former appearance and  memories.”  "}
{"text": "“T see. So you will be able to summon me, too.”  “You’ve died with me nine times, so I can summon nine different Raviels.”  “T forbid it.”  "}
{"text": "“All right.”  I never intended to summon the Lady of the Silver Lily in the first place. No matter what the  "}
{"text": "circumstances were. But her voice and words cut off the possibility for good.  Love was a sacred promise and a contract.  "}
{"text": "We were writing our own laws, rules for just us two.  “T’]l add one more thing to your punishment should you betray me. Dispose of that skill.”  “T will.”  "}
{"text": "Then, I chose my next words. She was the one I loved. She was the one who would love me. She was  the person I had to treasure and treat cautiously the most in the world.  "}
{"text": "“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you earlier.”  “If you promise me something else, I’ll forgive you.”  “Anything.”  "}
{"text": "“Don’t kill yourself without my permission.”  “Don’t die even when it’s an easy escape. You are my lover. You can’t be someone who throws away  his life carelessly. Even if you don’t think you can escape death, struggle until the end.”  "}
{"text": "I was silent.  I was engraving the promise I made with her in my heart.  "}
{"text": "“T won't.”  “Tell me what you want from me.”  "}

{"text": "An unexplainable frustration filled my heart. I felt like I forgot something, something extremely  important. The more I tried to remember it, the further my thoughts seemed to wander, as if I could  never grasp it.  "}

{"text": "“Did you enjoy your dinner with His Highness?”  “Yes, very much. Listen to this, butler. His Highness gave me a blue coral ring today!”  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Golden Silk smiled wide. ‘Blue coral’ was the name of the gem. It wasn’t worth much,  but it was often used for proposals in the southern regions of the empire.  “Also, it happened in the student cafeteria, right in front of all the other ladies and gentlemen! The  "}

{"text": "1.  The Lady of the Silver Lily stood in the corridor in the dead of night.  Behind her was a large mirror.  "}
{"text": "A mirror big enough to reflect her whole body.  Smooth and clean.  "}
{"text": "The mirror where moonlight reflected only the lady’s poised back. The mirror reflected just a ray of  moonlight and silver hair, so the Lady of the Silver Lily looked like an island alone in a dark sea.  "}

{"text": "Ivansia, this... Is this a dream? Are you appearing in my dream?”  The Lady of the Silver Lily reacted by looking at me with a strange expression. The smile on her lips  somehow felt like a scar.  "}
{"text": "“That’s an interesting question. Indeed, your dream has consumed my life. I now know that love is just  giving one’s life to support another’s dream.”  "}
{"text": "What did that mean?  “T become your dream, and you become my life. This exchange of dreams and lives is what we call  "}
{"text": "love.”  What could she possibly mean?  "}
{"text": "I didn’t understand what she was saying. There were many other things I did not know, too.  The Lady of the Silver Lily explained one of the things I did not know with her scar-like smile.  "}
{"text": "“However, you probably didn’t ask that question in a romantic way. I shall answer you seriously. Don’t  worry because you don’t see any servants. I told them to go back.”  "}
{"text": "“Why...2?”  “And I shall warn you. Never call me [Heiress] with your mouth again.”  The Lady of the Silver Lily smiled.  "}
{"text": "“T will tear out your heart and kill you.”  I didn’t understand.  "}
{"text": "Just now, the Lady of the Silver Lily showed killing intent toward me. She wasn’t joking when she said  she would kill me. It wasn’t a bluff, either. If I called her ‘Heiress’ one more time, her rapier would  surely stab my heart.  "}
{"text": "That’s what would happen, but...  ‘Why?’  "}
{"text": "Why was her threat not cold but rather warm and tender?  Was it possible for a death threat to be so heartwarming?  “Come here.”  "}
{"text": "Her voice beckoned me. I couldn’t refuse her. As I approached the Lady of the Silver Lily, she pointed  to the full-body mirror. “What do you see?”  “ ..I. can see the lady standing next to me.”  "}

{"text": "I hadn’t vomited. Throwing up in front of the Duke of Ivansia’s daughter would be terrible. I  desperately pressed down my nausea.  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily was calm.  “T asked what you could see.”  "}
{"text": "She was a very cold person.  There was a bitter taste on the tip of my tongue.  “Words... I see strange letters. And voices... Weird voices are... I don’t really know.”  "}
{"text": "“Voices.”  The Lady of the Silver Lily smiled very slightly at that word. This smile looked more like a smile than  the one a little while ago.  "}
{"text": "“You’re being loved.”  “What are you saying...”  "}
{"text": "“Tell me about the words.”  She moved on so quickly, without any explanations, that I just stared blankly at her. Suddenly, her  "}
{"text": "smile turned arid, and she calmly repeated herself without pushing me.  “Did you not say you see strange letters? Tell me about them.”  "}
{"text": "“_..They’re hard to see. I don’t see complete words... just a few letters... Fragments...?”  “Read me at least one fragment.”  “Cher... Lo... Other than that, absolutely nothing.”  "}
{"text": "“Hmm.”  The Lady of the Silver Lily put her hand on her chin.  For some reason, her brows were furrowed.  "}
{"text": "“T see. [Cher] is part of [Teacher], and [Lo] is from [Lover]. What’s left at the end is very much like  you. But your master comes before your lover? It’s understandable, but I don’t like it.”  "}
{"text": "“Lady, there are too many things I don’t understand. You said this isn’t a dream, but if it isn’t, what do  you want from me?”  "}
{"text": "“T want you.”  “T apologize. I don’t understand that either—”  “What dream did you have?”  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily simply cut off my words.  ‘No matter how much power the Ivansia duchy holds—’  "}
{"text": "‘T am the one and only butler of the Lady of the Golden Silk—’  ‘His Highness the Crown Prince favors the young lady, but this treatment is—’  Countless thoughts were tangled in my head.  "}
{"text": "But none of them rang in my heart. Like music without rhythm, they soon faltered.  “T don’t remember much. But in my dream...”  What came out of my mouth, in the end, was an obedient answer to the lady’s question.  “In your dream.”  "}
{"text": "“~.. You looked at me and cried.”  That was right.  "}
{"text": "“T was in a chair... I think I was tied to it. With something like a rope. I don’t know why I was tied, but  only you were there in the ornate room, looking down at me.”  "}
{"text": "Just before waking up.  I had definitely seen that sight.  "}

{"text": "“You?”  “_..1 felt extremely guilty, like I had wronged you.”  “Yes?  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily smiled again.  My insides churned, and I felt like just looking at the smile would make me cry.  “At least you know to be sorry.”  "}
{"text": "“Do you know why you dreamed something like that?”  “No. I don’t know. Not at all...”  “Tt’s because that is my [trauma].”  "}
{"text": "Trauma.  “T haven’t told you yet, but my mother committed suicide.”  What?  "}
{"text": "I paled in shock.  “T was too young to understand why she committed suicide. The duke’s wife. The moon of Ivansia. A  "}
{"text": "woman with such power and wealth ended her life herself. I didn’t know why, but I do clearly  remember the words my mother whispered to me on her last night, how she was cremated quickly like  a coverup.”  "}
{"text": "This.  This was something I shouldn’t know. I shouldn’t even listen. I couldn’t believe the Ivansia duchy was  hiding such a secret. It was a terrible secret that could be used to start a political war.  "}
{"text": "“However.”  The Lady of the Silver Lily looked at me.  "}
{"text": "“Even that memory did not become my trauma.”  “The crown prince gave a blue coral ring to the Lady of the Golden Silk today.”  One step.  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Silver Lily came closer to me.  "}
{"text": "“In a past life, that made me despair. Or perhaps I was angry. You can say that I was jealous or envious.  All these filled my heart. Cursing the world, I took a sword and stabbed the heart reflected in the  mirror.”  "}
{"text": "However, there was no sound of footsteps.  Only then did I realize she was barefoot.  “But even that is no longer my trauma.”  Press.  "}
{"text": "The lady’s foot stepped on my shoe.  The light and insignificant weight tied down one of my feet. If I wanted to retreat, I could have, and if I  wanted to shake her off, it would have been simple. Nonetheless, the weight on my foot kept me there.  "}
{"text": "“Ten days, repeating eternally.”  Her hand drew nearer.  "}
{"text": "“My world, stained in blood and perishing. The demons mocking me, imitating my tongue and lips.  Everything that once scarred my heart is no longer my trauma.”  "}
{"text": "A light grip.  “They stopped being my trauma.”  My neck.  "}
{"text": "“From now on, you are the only one who can hurt my heart.”  Both of her hands loosely held my neck.  "}
{"text": "“Even if someone with the most wicked tongue cursed me for two days, it wouldn’t measure to the  sighs you send me in ignorance.”  From her little finger to her forefinger. From the thinnest to the thickest finger, I felt every single bit of  "}

{"text": "Raviel quickly discerned what he was trying to do. He was going to completely immerse himself in the  role of the butler. Then, by regressing one day from the butler’s perspective, he would return to a time  before she gave her heart to the mirror.  "}

{"text": "‘He looks gentle, but these tricks come from that head.’  "}
{"text": "It was good that the man she came to love was not stupid. Indeed, it was very pleasant. Nevertheless,  Raviel Ivansia objected.  -But, Gongja. This is dangerous.  "}
{"text": "The reason was clear.  -I won't remember you.  "}
{"text": "She, Raviel Ivansia, would not remember Kim Gongja.  Even if he regressed and stopped her from stabbing the mirror heart, thus preventing the tragedy of the  eternal ten days, it meant nothing if she couldn’t remember him.  "}
{"text": "-I don’t want to kill you.  -I want to live with you.  "}
{"text": "My days with you.  The first holiday I was allowed, resting for 15 days.  "}
{"text": "All of these memories made up who I am now. Once they were gone, I would no longer be Raviel  Ivansia.  "}
{"text": "Does the man in front of me know that? That I wouldn’t be grateful at all if I escaped the labyrinthine  ten days like this?  -It’ll be all right.  "}
{"text": "He seemed to know.  -I’Il definitely resolve the issue somehow.  "}
{"text": "Seeing how detestably he spoke, he probably knew.  -Please trust me.  Raviel Ivansia was silent.  "}
{"text": "She was briefly paralyzed by the cruelty of his words. Trust him? Without any explanation, trust him?  Tardily, too late, she regretted her promise from a few days ago. But this was too serious for Raviel  Ivansia to be trapped by paralysis and regret.  "}
{"text": "‘T’ll trust you.’  She would trust the man she loved. She would trust in that man’s ability. He was the man whom she  "}
{"text": "chose. He was hers. He would definitely succeed, [no matter what], to persuade the Tower to regress to  the previous day.  The real problem would come after that.  "}
{"text": "‘How can I reverse the immersion rate if it’s over 90%?’  "}
{"text": "If he succeeded in returning to the previous day, then he would be unable to remember who he was.  Even if he remembered anything, it would only be a vague feeling. It would be impossible for him to  remember the days that he spent with her in any detail.  "}
{"text": "“Wait a moment.’  There was a way.  Raviel groaned when she thought of it, and then she groaned again. The rumor that all of the poison in  "}
{"text": "the empire came from her heart flashed in her mind. It didn’t for long. She couldn’t waste time like  that.  Raviel Ivansia realized that she would have to follow through on her plan.  "}

{"text": "Trauma.  The man had confessed almost everything about himself to her. He informed her that a side effect of his  "}

{"text": "When she killed him, he would see [this moment].  It wasn’t the past or anything, but it was this exact moment while she was thinking.  If so. If she could pull it off.  "}
{"text": "-I can tell him what I want to say, give him what memories I want to pass on, let him know everything  again.  "}

{"text": "Are you listening?  "}
{"text": "I am happy because of you. I don’t want to lose you. I don’t want to let go of the time I’ve spent with  you like this.  You said this before. That you would ‘write a diary starting today.’ You said that you would show me  "}

{"text": "Look at me.  Look at you beside me.  "}
{"text": "You’re a dumb person. You’re also naive. I wondered how you survived in the world with such  innocence, but I soon learned that you had died thousands of times.  You had many reasons to abandon your innocence. There were few reasons to keep your naivety. To  "}

{"text": "Just as I believe in you, you should believe in me.  Rely on me.  "}
{"text": "-So... so that I can never forget you, don’t let me forget you even if I die...  -I know.  "}
{"text": "You alone cannot protect yourself.  I alone cannot protect this world.  But if it’s the two of us, you and I, we can do anything.  "}
{"text": "I’m also afraid. Killing you is terrifying.  Staying beside you, even though I know I’Il be hurt, is hellishly frightening.  But my fears will not stand in my way of being with you.  "}

{"text": "Finally, you, who has become your role of the butler, speak to me.  -Heiress Ivansia.  Crush.  "}

{"text": "It wasn’t proper for a noblewoman to say those words so openly, but Raviel felt it with all her heart.  She loved the crown prince, noodle-hair and all.  Noodle hair? Why had she thought of that?  "}
{"text": "The blond locks on the prince’s head did share a peculiar resemblance to last night’s dinner.  Raviel shook her head and continued tightening the bonds around the crown prince. He, in return,  mumbled something behind his gag. It may have been a scream. Raviel didn’t particularly care. Rather,  "}
{"text": "it was almost cute.  “T love you so much, Your Highness, and it pains me to see you ruin yourself like this. I should never  have helped you to ditch the palace tutors when we were children. I see now that it is up to me to  "}
{"text": "correct my wrongs.”  She cleared her throat, and a gray-haired servant held up a board with words written on it.  "}
{"text": "[Lesson 1. Only a scumbag cheats on his fianceé.]  The board was nicely decorated at the borders with lilies. The lily leaves were choking a man’s neck.  The crown prince stopped mumbling as his eyes glazed over in fear.  "}
{"text": "“Don’t be an idiot. I’m not going to kill you.”  When Raviel sniffed disdainfully, she noted that the man had peed himself.  She sighed.  "}
{"text": "“Get him a change of pants,” she told the gray-haired servant. “Now I’ll have to start all over again.”  The gray-haired servant gracefully bowed and left the room.  "}
{"text": "In the meantime, Raviel set up the camera. She had been told that the camera was cutting-edge  technology that could be used to preserve memories.  Blackmail was a good memory, was it not?  "}
{"text": "It only took two days after Raviel’s loving remedial lessons for the crown prince to act foolishly again.  Maybe she should have bashed in that noodle-like noggin of his to make spaghetti. Flavor was always  important in a good dish, and red would suit him so well...  "}
{"text": "Raviel had been absent from school that day due to her illness. However, she was more than capable of  arranging transport to the dormitories where the Lady of the Golden Silk resided.  "}
{"text": "She did have to catch up on her work, but she could spare half an hour for this.  When she stepped out of the carriage, it was nighttime. Most students were already in their beds, except  "}
{"text": "the few strolling in the warm spring air.  Magnolias drifted in front of her, white and pure.  "}
{"text": "Crunch. She crushed them underfoot. This made their perfume even more fragrant.  Raviel made herself at home in the parlor of the residence hall. She waited for her guest to come out.  Five minutes later, the Lady of the Golden Silk and her gloomy-looking butler came bustling in.  "}
{"text": "The Lady of the Golden Silk’s makeup looked like it had been hastily done. Raviel covered her grin by  opening her fan.  "}
{"text": "“What did you call me for?” asked the Lady of the Golden Silk.  Her tone of speaking was still too brash for a country chit. Her butler placed a gentle hand on her  elbow, not that she was heeding his silent warning.  "}
{"text": "“T didn’t call you for anything,” said Raviel, amused. “I was just sitting, and you just arrived.”  The Lady of the Golden Silk opened her mouth like a goldfish before closing it again.  "}
{"text": "“Who else would you have come for?”  Who else indeed?  “Maybe I came to meet your butler,” Raviel joked.  "}
{"text": "She watched as the Lady of the Golden Silk turned furious eyes upon her servant and her butler  stuttered denials, flushing.  "}
{"text": "Flushing?  Perhaps she could make use of that. She shelved the thought for later.  “T was kidding. April Fools, and all that,” Raviel said. “Anyway, I have a gift for you.”  "}
{"text": "She held out an envelope for the Lady of the Golden Silk to take. The butler grabbed it, and their  gloved hands brushed against each other.  "}
{"text": "The butler suspiciously reddened again. He turned around and handed the envelope to his lady.  “Check it,” said the Lady of the Golden Silk.  No doubt that she suspected her of putting something nasty.  "}
{"text": "The butler obediently opened the envelope. His eyes turned wide and round.  “U-uh... Um... This is...?”  "}
{"text": "“A moment of the crown prince when he was vulnerable,” said Raviel. “I thought you might enjoy it,  since you are ever so close to him.”  Swiik. The Lady of the Golden Silk’s hand swiped away the photograph so quickly that Raviel nearly  "}
{"text": "missed it.  “Th-th-that’s...”  "}
{"text": "Raviel had taken some liberties with the prince as he was in his remedial lessons. The results were  unsuitable to be in any record, print or photograph.  "}
{"text": "The barony’s lady’s face turned red, then green. Perhaps she should have been called the Lady of the  Copper Silk.  Mission complete, Raviel left the dormitory without another word to the idiot duo.  "}
{"text": "She was satisfied with her work for today. What was left of her heart was still breaking after the prince  had gone on another date with the Lady of the Golden Silk, but at least she could drag him down with  her.  "}
{"text": "If he was dumped... If his heart broke, and she was there to help him... Would his eyes turn kind  again? Would he smile at her like he used to do, once upon a time?  "}
{"text": "She didn’t need him to love her back, necessarily.  Even friendship—no, a lack of enmity—would be enough.  "}

{"text": "Why did time pass by so slowly?  Raviel had been waiting for Gongja to regress for six days since the last time. There was a version of  him running around, and she was rather fond of him, but he wasn’t the same as her lover.  "}
{"text": "Raviel’s work was done nearly on autopilot now. She had done this time loop for so long that she didn’t  need to focus as she signed papers, arranged for the prince’s assassins to be taken out, and made sure  that the economy didn’t implode because of a poorly received tariff.  "}
{"text": "Gongja 3 (her nickname for the current version of the butler) squirmed on her lap.  “Can I move now, milady? I really don’t think this is appropriate...”  “Nonsense. You’re my exclusive butler, are you not? This is what butlers do in this world.”  "}
{"text": "Gongja 3’s eyes showed that he knew she was bullshitting him, but he wasn’t certain enough to call her  out on it.  "}
{"text": "Raviel ruffled Gongja 3’s hair. It was nearly imperceptible, but he leaned into her touch. Maybe quiet  days like this weren’t so bad, though she still eagerly awaited Gongja Prime.  "}
{"text": "“I’m going to miss you when you’re gone.”  Gongja 3 stiffened on her lap. Slowly, his head turned toward her.  “Do you... intend to kill me>”  "}
{"text": "What was it with her love interests thinking that she would kill them?  “No, butler. Don’t take things so seriously. I won’t ever kill you.”  "}
{"text": "This statement didn’t hurt her until much afterward, when she was staring into her beloved’s dead face,  a sword in her hands. Thus, it did not become her trauma.  3.  "}
{"text": "“Gongja, please... Say syke...”  Tears flowed from Raviel’s eyes as she held the body of her dead lover.  “You liar.”  "}
{"text": "She continued in that position. She felt the last of his body heat escape from her arms. Raviel closed his  eyes, wishing him a quick regression.  "}
{"text": "She did not draw her blade from his chest. She wasn’t sure that she ever wanted to hold that particular  rapier ever again.  "}
{"text": "It was a long time later, what felt like an eternity to her, when she stood up.  Raviel must have been dizzy from crying so much. Her vision blurred, and she walked right into a wall.  “Motherfu—”  "}
{"text": "Painful and humiliating as it might have been, this moment was not her trauma, either.  4.  “Raviel Ivansia,” said the Lady of the Golden Silk. “I love you.”  "}

{"text": "For her, fear in itself was a disgrace. It was an insult. But Raviel Ivansia constantly repeated this  terrifying scene, unleashing her dire imagination. She deliberately deepened the wound.  "}

{"text": "now.  “Hm. I don’t really care about legality. I’ll be satisfied with a small ceremony with us two.”  “No. It matters to me.”  "}
{"text": "Raviel stroked my cheek.  “This is the world I live in. I am loyal to this empire. My world and my nation needs to recognize my  marriage. Even if you are a commoner here, you are my lover, and every citizen of the empire must  "}
{"text": "accept you.”  “All right. But can we expect everyone to react well...?”  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s fine, Gongja,” Raviel said composedly. “Citizens who do not recognize you will die by my  hands.”  "}
{"text": "What do I do? She was too cool. I was falling in love again. I wanted to fall in love with her again and  again.  “T understand. Let’s have our wedding in your world, Raviel. But I also have a condition.”  "}
{"text": "“Speak it.”  “Breaking the engagement with the prince is necessary, but you shouldn’t be the one to initiate it. I  won’t be able to forgive anyone who speaks poorly of you when they know nothing.”  "}
{"text": "If anyone tried to point fingers at my beloved, I would break that finger. If anyone gossiped about her, I  would cut off their tongue. If anyone besmirched her, I would kill them.  "}
{"text": "I wasn’t kidding.  I’d give them a taste of hell.  "}
{"text": "“Tt should be obvious to everyone that it was the prince who is at fault and you simply had to break the  engagement.”  “Oho. Are you telling me to insult the nation’s foundation now? Me, the heir of the Ivansia duchy, who  "}

{"text": "again.  “Of course, we don’t actually have to go to court. The imperial family would not want to advertise this.  I just need to ask the emperor for a meeting with the evidence in tow.”  "}
{"text": "“When will you go to the palace?”  “As soon as possible.”  Raviel quietly pushed back my bangs.  "}
{"text": "“Gongja. When you marry me, you’ll be marrying into the Ivansia ducal family. The imperial family  will directly give you a title as my consort. And I will become your lord.”[1]  "}
{"text": "My heart throbbed.  “Officially, I will call you ‘Wife.’ You will call me ‘Husband.’ Is that acceptable?”  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s a hierarchical society, and you’re from the Ivansia family. I’m only an outsider. Don’t worry. It’s  just following the laws of the empire. I don’t mind it at all...”  “I’m glad you think it’s all right. I thought you would say that. So, test it out and call me ‘Husband.’ “  "}
{"text": "I paused.  “What’s wrong? Are you embarrassed?”  “You’re embarrassed. I knew it. I’ll try it out first.”  "}
{"text": "Her eyes smiled.  “Wife.”  "}
{"text": "My heart.  I gulped. Spit stuck to the back of my throat. I slowly tried to open my mouth, but it was glued shut.  My upper lip slid across my lower lip fruitlessly before barely making a sound.  "}
{"text": "“| ..H...usband.”  Raviel blinked.  "}
{"text": "A silence settled upon us.  My lover’s red eyes stared straight at me. How do I describe it? Her face looked like that of someone  "}
{"text": "who saw a hedgehog’s paws. In other words, I had no idea what her expression meant.  “Gongja.”  "}
{"text": "“Yes.”  “Say it once more.”  “ ..Husband>?”  "}
{"text": "“Again.”  Hmm.  "}
{"text": "“Husband...?”  Raviel’s eyelashes fluttered. Her shoulders shrank a bit.  ‘What the heck is this reaction?’  "}
{"text": "I didn’t know it at first since Raviel kept a straight face, but I soon realized it. No way. Maybe? Could  it be? No, this wasn’t possible, even if it was the end of the world, but...  "}
{"text": "“Raviel. Are you embarrassed right now?”  “Mm...”  Raviel mumbled.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s insanely adorable. My man is...”  Her embarrassment infected me in an instant. This was crazy.  "}
{"text": "My face turned red, and my lips were dry. Still, my head worked just fine. At this time, it would be best  to counterattack by saying [Raviel is the cutest person in the world]. I could return all the damage I’d  received from Raviel so far. But I couldn’t do that. I felt so flustered I thought I would die.  "}
{"text": "Instead, I compromised.  “Husband.”  "}
{"text": "Rather than a one-sided attack, both sides could flirt. We could force a draw with no winners or losers.  Did she understand my strategy? Raviel also opened her mouth.  “|..Wife.”  "}

{"text": "In the throes of love, I remembered the goal of this stage.  [To prevent the destruction of this world. ]  "}
{"text": "Also, the main cause of the end of the world was my husband’s artifact, the Holy Sword’s fragment,  and the spiraling of her wish.  ‘In other words, if I recover the fragment, the world won’t be destroyed by the demons.’  "}

{"text": "‘My husband ascended to a semi-Constellation from stabbing a fragment of the Holy Sword in her  heart.’  "}
{"text": "A Constellation was said to be the representative of a world. They were barriers that protected the  world.  "}
{"text": "In other words, this world only had half a shield.  But my husband currently had no sword in her heart. Therefore, she had not yet ascended.  Rephrasing that statement, there was no Constellation protecting the world at the moment.  "}
{"text": "“Let’s plan the wedding for a month from now,” I said. “It’ll be exactly ten days after I first possessed  the butler.”  One month later from this moment.  "}
{"text": "“IT see. You’re matching the timing.”  We set the date for our wedding for the day this world originally would have ended. It was to reject the  last moments of the world and remake it into our new beginning.  "}
{"text": "It was an audacious choice.  "}
{"text": "“Tf so, itll be quite a bit of work for me. But should everything go well, we can have our wedding next  month.”  “What sort of things need to be done?”  "}
{"text": "“First, I need to break the engagement with the crown prince. Next, I must succeed my father’s  position.”  "}
{"text": "Raviel said it as if it were only natural.  “Tt will be difficult to marry you with my current status. The legal procedures are bothersome, and  "}
{"text": "society will squawk about having a commoner betrothed to a noble. It’1l be annoying. I’d rather  become the duchess and take you as my consort. When I become the family head, I can arrange things  as I please.”  "}
{"text": "“Wits.”  I was speechless.  “Raviel. I still have quite a few of the butler’s memories. It’s... Isn’t it quite difficult for the heiress to  "}
{"text": "succeed as the family head? Especially for the Ivansias. It’s the noble and great Ivansia family.  Succeeding the duchy just because you want to is...”  “You’re right. It would be difficult if I were not me,” Raviel said calmly. “However, I am Raviel  "}
{"text": "Ivansia.”  What do I do? She was too cool. I was falling for her again. I wanted to fall in love with her again and  again.  "}
{"text": "“The duchy’s vassals have already pledged allegiance to me. I also have military power. If my father  wants to hold on to his power until the end, his only choice is to go running to His Majesty the  Emperor.”  "}
{"text": "Thud.  Raviel dumped a stack of papers onto the table.  "}
{"text": "“T have plenty of evidence that proves the crown prince’s infidelity. The emperor is as competent as the  special operatives he commands. He will defend the dignity of the imperial family rather than stay  loyal to my father, who has no real power.”  "}
{"text": "“You phrase it like you have respect for the emperor, but Raviel... isn’t that the same thing as  blackmailing him...>?”  "}
{"text": "“Wife.”  Raviel looked at me seriously. I twitched when she called me her wife. We were calling each other  [husband] and [wife] in order to get used to the new titles, even when we were alone.  "}
{"text": "“Yes, my husband?”  "}
{"text": "“You have a job in the Tower, not in this world. I understand if you do not frequently return to my  world and this empire. You should understand that I cannot relinquish my noble title.”  Hearing it like this made me feel like a spouse who worked abroad...  "}
{"text": "“But there will be occasions when you need to be with me. For example, at the events for the end of the  year and New Year’s. Furthermore, the events held by the Duke or Duchess and his or her consort are  always political affairs. You will be the Moon of Ivansia, and you will be honored as the noblest  "}

{"text": "“Loyalty to the emperor and blackmail of the imperial family can coexist, then. It isn’t as if the empire  is harmed when my husband becomes the Ivansia family head. Rather, I am fortunate to have such a  capable noblewoman as my husband.”  "}
{"text": "“My wife knows to read between the lines. He’s capable, smart, and cool.”  “Of course. I’m Raviel’s man.”  “T love you.”  "}
{"text": "“T love you.”  We took a moment to kiss each other.  "}

{"text": "“T brought her over, milady.”  The Lady of the Golden Silk’s jaw dropped.  "}
{"text": "“We already know each other, but I shall greet you again,” Raviel said, holding a fan.  “T am Raviel Ivansia, daughter and successor to the Duke of Ivansia. I received the epithet of the Silver  Lily from His Majesty the Emperor.”  "}

{"text": "My lover, Raviel Ivansia, was a person who followed through on her words.  If Raviel said our wedding would take place within a month, it really would.  “T’ve detained my father in our villa,” Raviel said, casually and calmly.  "}

{"text": "“Uhh...”  "}
{"text": "My father-in-law was incarcerated overnight.  ‘Is this all right?’  While I was feeling uneasy for an in-law I had never met, Raviel looked at me.  "}
{"text": "“You are now the fiancé of the Duchess of Ivansia. You are the host of the second highest-ranking  family.”  "}
{"text": "“Other than the emperor, the empress, and the prince, there is no one you must bow your head to. At  least, not in this empire. All citizens of the empire, regardless of status, must bow to you. In the absence  of the imperial family, you will be treated with the highest regard.”  "}
{"text": "Raviel was serious.  It was only after I heard her words that I felt that [something huge] was happening.  "}
{"text": "Until now, I thought of our wedding only in terms of my love for Raviel. Our love was sweet. It was  romantic. But for Raviel, marriage was more than just romance.  The immense truth of the matter dawning on me, I opened my mouth.  "}
{"text": "“But [I’m only a commoner...”  “Of course, the socialite biddies will gossip. Gongja. Your past is like the train of an uncomfortable  dress, and it will follow you wherever you go. But I’ve taken what measures we could.”  "}
{"text": "Measure.  “What did you plan?”  "}
{"text": "“You will become the adopted son of the grand chamberlain of the imperial palace.”  Raviel handed me a sheet of paper.  "}
{"text": "“The grand chamberlain has served the imperial family for a long time. He was awarded a noble rank;  his personal record is clean; and his honor is regarded highly. Most importantly, he has no children.  Becoming the son of this old chamberlain will raise your status immediately.”  "}
{"text": "Oh, my god.  No, really. Oh, my god.  “T-is that allowed?”  "}
{"text": "“Tt is. If I want it to be.”  Even now, Raviel was working through a mountain of files. Swipe! Raviel’s quill never stopped  moving. It was hard for me to guess the contents of those documents and the political repercussions  "}

{"text": "I realized belatedly as I signed the adoption papers how momentous it was to become [the wife of the  Duchess of Ivansia].  It was clearly demonstrated by the scenes that I faced a few days later.  "}
{"text": "“Greetings to the second brightest moon in the empire.”  Even if I was just passing by the academy, the noble ladies and gentlemen recognized me and yielded  to me. They were utterly courteous. The rumors had spread to the academy at some point.  "}
{"text": "“T pay my respects to the lord of the house of Ivansia.”  “Ah. All right...”  "}
{"text": "“Congratulations on your betrothal. May there be eternal glory to the Ivansias.”  “T-thank you.”  "}
{"text": "The students stopped talking whenever I walked by. They stopped whatever they were doing and  remained silent and polite until I left. The academy’s guards, including the knights, saluted respectfully  when they saw me.  "}
{"text": "There were no exceptions.  Even the academy teachers bowed as if it were natural.  Even when I reached rank 3 in the Tower, even when I became a popular celebrity and was surrounded  "}

{"text": "I wasn’t a star. I wasn’t an entertainer. These people weren’t surrounding me or using their smartphones  to take a picture of my face.  "}
{"text": "They merely kneeled.  *...Amazing.’  They probably only acted like this in front of me. I would bet that as soon as I left, they would spread  "}
{"text": "all sorts of dirty rumors about my origin and about Raviel and the prince’s unconventional breakup.  However, nobody dared to gossip in front of me.  “Eek! ”  "}
{"text": "Shatter!  "}
{"text": "One day, an academy servant broke a jug of water while moving it. I was just passing by. I wanted to  ask, [Are you OK?], but at that moment, six servants prostrated themselves at once.  “W-we apologize!”  "}
{"text": "“We deserve to die!”  “Please. We have gravely erred in our foolishness, so please forgive...!”  I was speechless.  "}
{"text": "I hadn’t become dumbfounded for some other reason.  No, it was that they seemed to be asking me for forgiveness like it was expected. The fact that I had the  "}
{"text": "[right to forgive them] paralyzed me.  In other words, I could decide to punish them and not forgive them.  It was crazy.  "}
{"text": "This was definitely crazy.  -What’s the problem? It’s obvious things would turn out like this.  Bae Hu-ryeong said while swimming in the air.  "}
{"text": "-It’s your Tower, which cares about status and class in name only, that’s weird. Didn’t you know? If  you go up to the 50th floor, you’!I find that most towers are defined by hierarchical societies.  "}
{"text": "I think Bae Hu-ryeong mentioned we would compete with towers from other worlds after the 50th  floor.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong picked his ear with his pinky and blew away the earwax.  -Your husband’s family, Ivansy or whatever, is second only to the imperial family in this world. That  means that you’re pretty much a queen, Zombie.  "}
{"text": "A queen.  -Congratulations on becoming Cinderella, bro.  The shoulders of the servants lying prostrate in the hallway were trembling.  "}
{"text": "Suddenly, what Raviel said came to my mind.  [Every citizen of the empire must accept you. |  [My world and my nation need to recognize my marriage. J  This was exactly what she was talking about.  In just a few days, I had risen to the top of the pyramid.  "}
{"text": "I had reached the pinnacle of power.  "}
{"text": "‘This is... Raviel’s world.’  If so.  ‘How should I act?’  "}
{"text": "Not just as [Kim Gongja]...  Not as the Hunter [Death King]...  "}
{"text": "But as the [spouse] of the noblest family in this land.  I bent over.  Then, I picked up a fragment of the broken jug.  "}
{"text": "I quietly placed a fragment in the palm of the servant who had erred.  “Make this into a necklace and wear it on your body.”  I opened my mouth.  "}
{"text": "“The necklace is the accessory closest to one’s heart. Keep your mistake close to heart. Reflect and  repent for it.”  “Don’t wait for me to forgive you. When you yourself think and feel that it is enough, you may forgive  "}
{"text": "yourself. Do you understand?”  “Y-yes...!”  I turned and walked away.  "}
{"text": "That evening, Raviel said to me, “My wife responded thoughtfully.”  I cut some meat with a knife and fork. I was learning table manners over dinner. Raviel moved her  hands deliberately and slowly on the other side of the table so that I could watch and learn.  "}
{"text": "“Um. Well. Did I do well?”  "}
{"text": "“You were excellent. If you forgave the servant too easily, people would have said, [He isn’t strict  because of his humble background. How can he manage the duchy with that attitude?] If you punished  them too sternly, the rumor that [He’s getting full of himself when he climbed ranks overnight] would  have spread.”  "}
{"text": "Either way would have struck out.  “People would have cursed you whether you forgave the servants or punished them, wife. In this case,  "}
{"text": "the event itself is not important; the presentation is. You wisely wrapped up the situation by creating a  moving story.”  Raviel smiled.  "}
{"text": "“What happened today has already been disseminated throughout the empire’s social circles. Those  with a pure curiosity will admire your heart, and those with thick heads will admire your sagacity. I  thought you were an amateur at politics. What magic did my beloved use?”  "}
{"text": "“_..I just thought of you, Raviel.”  My knife split the egg yolk.  The color of a young chick deflated.  "}
{"text": "“T knew you were working hard in spots that I can’t see.”  “Mm.”  “T thought of how much you think of me, and naturally, I thought about you, too.”  I had thought from Raviel’s perspective.  f How should I act to best help my husband? J  "}
{"text": "“Tf I forgave the servants, I would have been seen as a soft-hearted duke consort. If I punished them, I  would be seen as a strict one. However, I thought that being perceived as a [wise consort] would be the  most helpful for you.”  "}
{"text": "“Why is that?”  "}
{"text": "“People won’t think that my husband is generous just because her wife acts kindly. Similarly, my  strictness doesn’t affect your image.”  The candle on the table went out.  "}
{"text": "“However, if I am wise, Raviel must also be wise. Choosing a [sensible spouse] is wise in itself.”  Raviel covered her lips with a white napkin.  “You thought of me.”  "}

{"text": "The specialist who managed all religions on the planet with the authority “Ten Thousand Temple’  smiled widely.  "}
{"text": "“Simply put, the deities are the laws of their worlds! For example, there is a law that exists on our  world, Earth, which is the law of physics!

{"text": "Um.  “But we have nuclear weapons and guns, you know?”  "}
{"text": "“As I said, the laws of physics are the foundation of everything, no matter where you go! That means  that those two tools can come from any world where the technology is advanced enough!”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner continued that it would, however, be difficult to develop technology based just  on physics if magic and miracles were common. That didn’t mean that other worlds couldn’t invent  nuclear technology and guns anyway.  "}
{"text": "‘I guess there was also an Apocalypse destroyed by a nuclear war. The Saga of the Iron Knights in  Space, which is now our 23rd floor, was science fiction...’  Could it be...? Was Earth the weakest among the worlds?  "}

{"text": "“T see.”  Raviel tapped her mouth with the tip of her fan.  "}
{"text": "“Since the laws of physics are the underlying bases of most worlds, physical attacks can be used almost  anywhere.”  "}
{"text": "“That’s right! It is natural that those who aren’t bound by physics cannot attack physically. And if they  have physical bodies, then physical attacks will, of course, work on them!

{"text": "-Yeah. That’s why the Constellation Killer could break Shiny with his aura and why I wasn’t pushed  about when I only trained with a blade. That kid who controls the Black Dragon Guild could also make  pancakes of Preta with her beam. Physical power is a very powerful ‘law.’  "}
{"text": "[Shiny sullenly nods. ]  -It can be said that a Constellation’s class depends on how much they follow the laws of physics.  I wanted to ask what that meant, but the Heretic Questioner began to explain it right away.  "}
{"text": "“The part that I just said about reduced physical damage is unexpectedly important! This is because one  can follow the laws of physics but not be completely bound! And if that’s possible—”  "}
{"text": "“—Because all Constellations have their own laws, their apostles have to oppose the laws of physics  with those laws.”  “Ooh! As expected, you have a brilliant understanding of it! You are indeed Death King’s partner!”  "}

{"text": "-And concentrate.  “Yep.”  "}
{"text": "1. All Constellations have their  own laws.  2. Their apostles also obey those  "}

{"text": "A ‘god of love,’ the Heretic Questioner added.  “This Constellation [translates everything in the world to romance]. In a world ruled by Barbit, power  and wealth are meaningless! A person’s strength is determined by how much romance power they  "}

{"text": "“Mm! You have to see it.”  The Heretic Questioner combined his hands to make a sign.  “Sacred Technique, Psyche.”[1]  "}

{"text": "“Aha. This is temporary, but I’ve set up a sanctuary for the God Barbit! Try doing something, Death  King!”  "}
{"text": "“Um ”  I looked around awkwardly. It was late at night. The Heretic Questioner, Raviel, and I were in Raviel’s  "}

{"text": "It was then. The Heretic Questioner hooked his foot around my ankle to trip me. “Huh?” I said, my  body tilting. “Um,” I said as I grabbed Raviel’s arm. “Aah?” The two of us fell to the floor.  "}
{"text": "“Hmm.”  Raviel stared down at me. She was on top of me, making it look like I was being attacked by her. It had  "}
{"text": "all happened in an instant.  “Gongja. Showing this kind of affection in front of someone else is embarrassing.”  “Uh. Uh...”  "}
{"text": "I was mortified.  “N-no! No! It’s not like that, Raviel! I was just falling...!”  "}
{"text": "“Ahaha.”  The Heretic Questioner laughed.  “Tt’s a pose you often see in romance works!”  "}
{"text": "“Heretic Questioner, this is...?”  “In Barbit’s sanctuary, every action leads to romance! You don’t simply fall; you draw in people around  "}
{"text": "you. Mhm. For example, if Death King wore a dress shirt and drank some water, there is a 95% chance  that the water will spill and show off his muscles! Everyone nearby would inevitably be flustered by  the sight!”  "}
{"text": "Oh, lord. What was that? Wasn’t that cosmic horror, not romance?  “Tn short, a sanctuary reinterprets the world and brainwashes people. It’s the same for the Great Library  we were in earlier! The Librarian interprets the world as [a collection of stories], and we are compelled  "}
{"text": "to be [characters].”  Poof.  "}
{"text": "When the Heretic Questioner made another sign, the circle of pink on the floor disappeared. Flushed, I  got out from under Raviel.  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner smiled widely and said, “Defeating the Constellations’ apostles with their laws  and the laws we can use. This is both a Holy War and a Star War!”  A Holy War and a Star War. In Korean, both would be written as “Sungjun.”[2]  "}
{"text": "“Hm. So how should we deal with the Holy War that will take place in ten days?”  “We need to know exactly which Constellations are involved! You can infer this from what I’ve said so  far, but our tactics will depend on the Constellations’ laws!”  "}
{"text": "“Certainly, knowing information about the enemy before the war is extremely important,” Raviel said,  her fan at her mouth.  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner nodded.  “Yes! So I ask you, which Constellations’ apostles are coming in ten days?”  Hm.  "}
{"text": "“Can you tell the laws from the names of the Constellations?”  “Tf you know their true names, it is 100% possible! I can look with my skill, [Ten Thousand Temple]!”  "}
{"text": "At that, I recalled some information about the young man... No, he was possessing the body of the  Lady of the Golden Silk, so young woman... in front of me.  "}
{"text": "‘It was around when I was fighting Preta on the 13th floor.’  When I was fulfilling the prophecy, the Black Dragon Guildmaster said that not only was the Heretic  "}
{"text": "Questioner skillful, but he was also knowledgeable of other worlds’ religions.  Good.  "}
{"text": "“A description... Can you infer a Constellation’s true name from their epithet?”  “Tf the Constellation is famous, yes!”  If that was so...  "}
{"text": "“They are [The Ox that Harvests Ruins], [The Warhorse of the Eternal Plains], and [The Evangelist of  Everlasting Happiness].”  "}
{"text": "“Hm.”  The Heretic Questioner rubbed his chin.  “(The Ox that Harvests Ruins] is Mutia. That Constellation’s main areas of control are [Destruction]  "}
{"text": "and [Re-creation]. It’s simple but powerful.”  Destruction and re-creation.  “How does it fight?”  "}
{"text": "“T guess... Its physical force can be used strongly at will! It can crush an area, dismantle a being’s  structure, and maybe recombine the structure afterward to create a golem. It’s very rare, but there are  times when it can also use the power of time! Time is also a part of the laws of physics!”  "}
{"text": "The Second Reincarnation Female Lead characteristic of the Lady of the Golden Silk was definitely  because of Mutia’s power, then.  "}
{"text": "An apostle of a Constellation beyond this world had already been present here.  ‘Is that why the Corner Librarian designated this world as an Apocalypse?’  "}
{"text": "In the Librarian’s perspective, could we intervene because there were outside Constellations already  interfering in this story?  Or was it just because there was no Constellation in this world, as Raviel said?  "}
{"text": "‘The former seems to match the Corner Librarian’s tendencies more so than the latter.’  While I was thinking about that, the Heretic Questioner continued.  “[The Warhorse of the Eternal Plains] is the epithet of Mahos. Its main areas of control are [Dueling]  "}
{"text": "and [War]. This is another simple but powerful force!”  Dueling and war.  “Does that mean they cannot deny a challenge to a duel or something like that?”  "}
{"text": "“Yes! Or spread a mania so that they are not afraid of death or dispense wisdom about tactics and  strategies! Ah. On the other hand, it can also forcefully make a peace zone by ‘banning war itself”!  That is a very rare case, though!”  "}
{"text": "“The one who controls war also controls peace... That sounds somewhat odd.”  Raviel smiled slightly at my mutter.  "}
{"text": "“There’s nothing strange about it. Peace is nothing more than a name for [the state in which war has  desisted]. Therefore, one who can effect war can, of course, effect peace.”  "}
{"text": "“Exactly!”  The Heretic Questioner smiled widely.  “T don’t know the true name of [The Evangelist of Everlasting Happiness]! It must be a Constellation  "}
{"text": "who hasn’t become famous yet!”  It was unknown.  "}
{"text": "‘If the Constellation isn’t famous, does it mean that it is weak, or is that an advantage?’  As I was locked in anguish, Shiny vibrated.  [Shiny wants to ask if he knows about the ‘Guardian Goddess.’ ]  "}
{"text": "‘Shiny... You were the one who told me to focus on the meeting...’  [Shiny is advising on a very important issue! ]  “Why are you like this...’  "}
{"text": "[Shiny declares she isn’t being selfish at all and that this is to determine how accurate the Heretic  Questioner’s information is! ]  "}
{"text": "Hm.  “T... It’s a little off-topic, but do you know about the [Guardian Goddess]?”  “Oho.”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner grinned.  “The [Guardian Goddess] is Hwiya’s descriptor! As her name suggests, her areas of control are mainly  "}
{"text": "[Protection] and [Immortality]! She is a very powerful deity, but my Ten Thousand Temple skill says  she lost her strength because of a certain event.”  [Shiny sparkles, saying that this person is genuine and can be trusted! ]  "}
{"text": "“Gongja. Why is your sword suddenly doing that? It’s hurting my eyes.”  “Just a moment. I’1l wrap it up...”  "}
{"text": "[Shiny screams for the warrior to stop.]  Anyway, while I received confirmation that the Heretic Questioner’s information was correct, Raviel  "}
{"text": "tapped her chin with her fan.  “Tt’ll be difficult... Each enemy is of a different type. Are there a total of three enemies?”  “Tt’ll be even more difficult since each apostle might borrow different levels of power!”  "}
{"text": "“Even so, we can see the broad strokes. Thank you for sharing your information.”  “Aha, saving this world will help our Tower! It’s efficient to help you!”  “Ts that so?”  "}
{"text": "“Yes! And my other skill, [Sacred Technique], can borrow the powers of any god I know the true name  of! Combined with everyone’s strengths, we will find a way!”  "}
{"text": "Our strength.  Raviel and I looked at each other. Then, we opened our mouths at the same time.  “Tt’s love.”  "}
{"text": "“That will be love.”  There would be plenty of people who are better at fighting than us, and there would be people who are  "}
{"text": "smarter than we are, but we were confident in one thing. Our love was greater than anyone else’s.  “ ..Huh?”  The Heretic Questioner tilted his head.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s weird, Death King. When I see the two of you being lovey-dovey, the area around my heart feels  tingly and numb. I never felt something like this before, so what could it be?”  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s a heart attack.”  “T also heard a message that my immersion rate got higher! How should I interpret this?”  “No... For now, please be careful with the immersion rate.”  "}
{"text": "If the Lady of the Golden Silk swallowed the Heretic Questioner before the war, we would be  hamstrung.  "}
{"text": "Regarding what we said earlier, Raviel and I were on the same page. She said,  “The ‘love’ we mentioned has a meaning other than the general definition.”  “What is that?”  “T’m sorry, but I can’t share. Let’s say it’s a secret weapon.”  "}
{"text": "“Umm, but I can’t take it into account when we’re plotting...”  "}
{"text": "“That’s all right. Let’s discuss basic tactics and steps instead. As I am powerful in this world, I can  arrange for security forces to be anywhere in the wedding hall. For example, I can borrow the  emperor’s special operatives...”  "}
{"text": "“Oho. How skilled are those operatives...”  Like that, Raviel and the Heretic Questioner sat across each other and continued to talk.  ‘This will work.’  "}
{"text": "The sight of the once-love rivals—though one of their personalities had obviously been swapped—  talking determinedly to fight together filled me with optimism.  ‘This will definitely work!’  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong entered my vision like a bucket of cold water.  -Gongja. Don’t be an idiot. Being invaded by three apostles is no easy thing.  ‘How bad will it be?’  "}
{"text": "-Think of it as about 1.5 times the strength of Preta on the 12th floor.  What a novel unit of measurement.  "}
{"text": "‘Preta was a Constellation. The invaders now are apostles. Wouldn’t apostles be weaker than a  Constellation?’  "}
{"text": "-She was the lowest-level Constellation. In terms of your Tower ranks, she was like a D-rank  Constellation.  ’12th-floor Preta was?’  "}
{"text": "-Yes, 12th-floor Preta was.  Bae Hu-ryeong continued to pick his ears.  "}
{"text": "-Well, I’m not worried since it’s you. No, I should say that I am not worried since it’s ‘you two.’  Bae Hu-ryeong glanced at Raviel.  Since he spent a long time beside me, he must have guessed what the ‘secret weapon’ Raviel mentioned  "}
{"text": "was.  It was the same for me too. Thus, I didn’t think that this invasion couldn’t be overcome.  But.  "}
{"text": "-But Zombie, don’t you want to clear this stage with zero casualties?  “Yes, that’s right.’  "}
{"text": "-You’ll have to think hard, then. Your hubby and that smartie-pants can take care of tactics, but you  should develop your personal fighting ability.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong looked down at me with his arms crossed.  -Hmm. Thinking about it, you’re also D-rank, right? You don’t intend to be that rank forever, do you?  Of course I didn’t.  "}
{"text": "5.  Ten days flew by like an arrow.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s finally your wedding day!”  In the empire, weddings were held in the evenings.  "}
{"text": "A marriage was the combination of the sun and the moon of the family. The evening, when the two  celestial bodies met in the sky, was becoming of a marriage. The clearer and redder the sunset, the  better it was for a wedding, and today was such a day.  "}
{"text": "“You look so splendid today, Duke Consort!”  I felt another strange feeling, surrounded by some servants.  Up to five servants stuck to me like beetles to lead me around. They kept saying, “How can you be so  "}
{"text": "beautiful?” “Her Excellency is so lucky!” and other silly things. My mind was overstimulated.  “Well, thank you all very much. You don’t have to fuss like this...”  “No, it’s no trouble!” the servants replied firmly.  "}
{"text": "“At least for today, the Duke Consort should be the most amazing groom in the nation! Frugality and  humbleness are virtues, but you cannot act like that now! Today, the only virtue is beauty!”  "}
{"text": "Oh, I’ve felt this once before...  It was the same as when the Black Dragon Guildmaster and the other guild masters went wild about me  "}
{"text": "getting a photoshoot...  Of course, there were also differences from that time.  “Congratulations on your wedding, Duke Consort.”  "}
{"text": "An old gentleman with a cool beard greeted me in the dressing room. I was confused because I didn’t  know who he was. Seeing my bafflement, the old gentleman smiled wryly.  "}
{"text": "“T am your foster father. I have a small position in running the imperial household. I heard a lot about  you from the new Duchess of Ivansia.”  "}
{"text": "“Ah...”  Oh, god. I was wondering who he was, and he was my father whom I was meeting for the first time!  “N-nice to meet you. Um. That’s, it’s...”  "}
{"text": "“You can call me Father. Don’t worry. I know that you won’t be able to see me as your father in your  heart. I won’t disturb the duchy by making use of my connection to you.”  The old man bowed his back very politely.  "}
{"text": "“T am going to retire after this wedding. Your husband was very considerate of me. Hoho. I won’t need  to worry about my days in retirement.”  "}
{"text": "A sigh slipped out from my mouth. How hard did Raviel work for today?  I spoke a word that I had never said in my life.  “ ..Father.”  "}
{"text": "“Yes, the moon of Ivansia?”  “T don’t know politics, and I have no connections to high society, so I don’t know about the conditions  "}
{"text": "in society. So I want to ask: What do the people of the empire say about this marriage?”  “Simply put, it has been highly unconventional,” the man said gently.  "}
{"text": "“The marriage of someone from the Ivansia ducal family is equivalent to a royal marriage. Naturally, it  is challenging to prepare for such an event on short notice. Moreover, Her Excellency broke the  engagement with His Highness the Prince and succeeded as her family head...”  "}
{"text": "At that moment, the old gentleman closed his mouth. It was because the outside of the dressing room  became very noisy. We could hear the murmurs of the guests.  "}
{"text": "“ Anyway, it would have been impossible if the Silver Lily Duchess had not persuaded His Majesty  the Emperor.”  The old man stroked his beard and beamed brightly.  "}
{"text": "“Duke Consort. Your husband is truly a capable person. Her loyalty to His Majesty is an irreplaceable  boon for the empire. Though I may only act as your father for today... If I may say something.”  "}
{"text": "That very moment, the gentleman’s eyes narrowed.  Simultaneously, a strong spirit emanated from the body of the old man that was almost comparable to  "}
{"text": "the Sword Saint.  “Considering your husband also requested my presence in my ‘other position’ and the security  arrangements of the wedding hall, it seems that today’s marriage will not go very smoothly.”  "}
{"text": "The grand chamberlain of the imperial family.  "}
{"text": "The moment the commander of His Majesty’s special operatives said so, the commotion outside the  dressing room turned into screams.  -Zombie. Get ready.  "}

{"text": "Except for three people.  “They’ve arrived.”  Raviel, the Heretic Questioner, and I were ready to fight back. Among us, Raviel was the one who had  "}

{"text": "Raviel organized the hall in an instant. Even the soldiers and nobles who were not under her command  obeyed her orders.  "}
{"text": "They felt something, instinctively. They didn’t understand why the sunset in the sky was shattered nor  why some unknown apostles appeared, but they knew if they followed Raviel Ivansia’s voice, they  could get through this situation.  "}
{"text": "“Can you figure out their abilities?”  Raviel asked the Heretic Questioner after rattling off a series of instructions.  “Yes! Just a moment!”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner made some hand signs. A white light flared from his hands.

{"text": "The wind pressure of the strike alone caused a tornado to form.

{"text": "-Raviel Ivansia!  Her eyes and voice were somewhat familiar.  "}
{"text": "-I won't give you a thing!  Shockingly, the apostle looked exactly like the Lady of the Golden Silk.  “L-lady of the Golden Silk...?”  "}
{"text": "“Why does she look like that?”  The guests chittered suspiciously. The Lady of the Golden Silk was a celebrity, too, even if she wasn’t  as famous as my husband. It was natural that many people recognized her face. Some of them  "}

{"text": "The guests who were being chased by the ghosts suddenly collapsed. It wasn’t just one or two of them,  either. Flop, flop. Like a marionette with cut strings, people lost their consciousnesses and dropped on  the spot.  "}

{"text": "The Heretic Questioner quickly made some hand signs. A light spilled from his hand and covered  Raviel and me.  “Aha, this is really not good! Mm. It’s a psychological attack. Those who are exposed to the song are  "}

{"text": "“First, we have to rearrange the layout of the wedding hall,” Raviel murmured quietly. “Now that we  know where the apostles will appear, we can focus on the special operatives and the warriors there.”  I realized this while preparing for the wedding, but the bride and groom held enormous power. We  "}

{"text": "Unfortunately, my skill [I Want To Become Just Like You] couldn’t copy the blessing used by the  Golden Silk.  "}

{"text": "-Yup. Those, to be precise, are buff effects that the Constellation casts on you with their skill. How else  would this work? If you want the blessing, go and get killed by the Constellations who are buffing the  apostles.  "}
{"text": "‘T get it already.’  I grumbled. The mechanism sounded like it was from a computer game, but what was before me was  "}
{"text": "reality, not a game.  And the Heretic Questioner made that reality clear.  "}
{"text": "“Tf there’s an apostle who can use psychological attacks, the number of guests needs to be reduced by a  lot! Especially if the apostle’s blessing is to recreate [one’s happy memories]!”  "}
{"text": "The candle flames flared and lit up the face of the Heretic Questioner.  It was the middle of the night.  The three of us were brainstorming together in a dressing room. On the table were the layout of the  "}
{"text": "wedding hall and the guest list. Raviel’s dressing room had been transformed into our secret war  council chamber.  “The most fatal poison in the world doesn’t cause pain. It makes people happy! There aren’t many  "}
{"text": "people who can escape the poison of happiness showered by [The Evangelist of Everlasting  Happiness]!”  “_..The problem is this.”  "}
{"text": "Raviel tapped the guest list with a long finger.  “The fewer guests we have, the more difficult it will be to deal with [The Warhorse of the Eternal  Plains]. This apostle can summon 10,000 soldiers. If you increase the guest list, we’ll suffer from  "}
{"text": "psychological attacks, but if we reduce the list, we’ll be crushed by the gap in numbers.”  “Hmm. That’s true. It’s complicated...”  "}
{"text": "The two were locked in troubled thoughts. The candles burned.  “Please leave it to me.”  I opened my mouth.  "}
{"text": "The two of them looked at me.  “Do you have a good idea, Death King?”  “Yes.”  "}
{"text": "I nodded. Then, I explained my strategy. As I continued to speak, Raviel and the Heretic Questioner’s  complexions gradually changed.  "}
{"text": "“_.. Indeed.”  Raviel looked at me in wonder.  “My wife is well-connected. If we act as you say, there won’t be any problems.”  "}
{"text": "Just as I didn’t need to exaggerate my admiration for her, Raviel did not hold back in praising me. I felt  a little embarrassed.  "}
{"text": "“But, there is a condition.”  “What is it?”  “Please allow me to wear black as well, Raviel.”  "}
{"text": "Raviel closed her lips.  In the empire, only the future head of the family could wear a black outfit on their wedding day. It  wasn’t a color I could wear as the duke consort. However, I had to wear black.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s not because I want to be the master of the duchy. Just...”  "}
{"text": "“No. You don’t need to make excuses. I know from a previous life that you aren’t someone who lusts  for power.”  Raviel shook her head.  "}
{"text": "“T only hesitated because of the customs of the empire. But I won’t ignore my wife’s wishes because of  some traditions. I’ll prepare your clothes.”  "}
{"text": "“Thank you.”  The three of us made eye contact and nodded. It was just a coincidence, but the moment we moved our  "}
{"text": "heads, the candle on the table flickered.  We’d finished all of our preparations.  "}
{"text": "3.  The evening approached.  The empire’s top nobles began to enter the wedding hall.  "}
{"text": "The wedding was announced and prepared in a month. It was happening extremely quickly, but no  aristocrat had the guts to refuse an invitation to an Ivansia’s wedding. No matter how much they cursed  Raviel internally, they had to smile on the outside.  "}
{"text": "Authority was a powerful gangster.  “ .. The layout of the hall is strange.”  "}
{"text": "Even the cowed nobles had to tilt their heads when they entered the wedding hall. They could  understand why the ceremony was being held outdoors and not inside a church. It would be difficult for  a union between a noble and a commoner to be blessed.  "}
{"text": "However.  “Why are the fighters grouped in one spot?”  The grand chamberlain, my adoptive father, entered the groom’s dressing room.  "}
{"text": "“Furthermore, this arrangement... Excuse me, but it looks like you’re expecting a battle. People who  can fight are in the front, and ordinary nobles are in the back.”  "}
{"text": "“T don’t know what you mean,” I replied naturally, surrounded and dressed by the attendants. The old  gentleman’s smile was swept away.  “Tt seems that you’ve cast the dregs who will be bothersome in battle in the rear and placed the useful  "}
{"text": "ones up front. Please excuse my disrespect.”  “My husband must have a reason for everything.”  “You’re also wearing a sword on your waist.”  "}
{"text": "“Yes. I always enjoyed practicing and training in the martial arts. Should the person who will become  the moon of Ivansia seem weak? And there might be a riot at the wedding. I have to be prepared.”  "}
{"text": "“Indeed. You need to be prepared for the unexpected...”  The old gentleman smiled bitterly.  "}
{"text": "“T understand. Then, I shall tell my colleagues to be prepared for an unknown situation, [just in case].  Ah, right. This is probably why Her Excellency chose me as her wife’s adoptive father...”  The old man bid me farewell and left the dressing room. He was probably going to go tell his followers  "}
{"text": "in the special operatives to prepare for battle.  This, too, was our desired response.  "}
{"text": "“The more people who can stay calm when something unexpected happens, the better.’  Raviel was already mobilizing people behind the scenes.  [The riffraff who are dissatisfied with this union will launch a terrorist attack.]  "}
{"text": "Fake rumors like those were being disseminated. No one would believe it, but aristocrats were very  mental beings. Just planting the idea of being alert would have a strong effect.  "}
{"text": "“Kyaaah!”  The effects were shown sooner than I expected.  “They’ve come.’  "}
{"text": "I dismissed the attendants and hurried out of the dressing room.  Simultaneously, voices that probably only the Heretic Questioner and I could hear in the world  "}
{"text": "reverberated.  [The apostle of “The Ox that Harvests Ruins’ has manifested. ]  [The apostle of ‘The Warhorse of the Eternal Plains’ has manifested. ]  "}
{"text": "[The apostle of ‘The Evangelist of Everlasting Happiness’ has manifested. ]  The same sunset I saw the previous day materialized. The sky cracked like a window, and three  apostles appeared through the rift.  "}
{"text": "“My God...”  "}
{"text": "“Good Lord, what is...”  The guests staggered to their feet. Like last time, they were shocked, but a closer look revealed that  their postures had changed. The warriors instinctively huddled and grabbed the hilts of their swords,  "}
{"text": "and the nobles who did not know how to fight glanced around, looking for a path of escape.  And.  “Heretic Questioner!”  "}
{"text": "Above all, my own behavior had changed.  “Yes, Death King!” replied the Heretic Questioner, who had been waiting in front of the dressing room.  “From now on, I will ride on Death King’s back!”  "}
{"text": "“Okay! ”  “Sacred Technique, Divine Transmission!”  ’  "}
{"text": "The moment I first realized the Heretic Questioner was a psycho was when the Devil King of Fall Rain  and the Guardian Goddess divided us with a test. The Heretic Questioner used sacred techniques then.  "}
{"text": "Its effect is teleportation.  -Huh?  "}
{"text": "Our destination was the red expanse of the sky.  -Wh-what?  The apostle with the hammer. We were right behind the Lady of the Golden Silk.  "}
{"text": "The Golden Silk looked at me in bewilderment. Clank! The Holy Sword I wielded and her hammer  clashed. The gravity of the tall sky was crushing down on me. I cried, feeling my body plummeting  down.  "}
{"text": "“One more time!”  “Ahaha! Yes! Sacred Technique, Divine Transmission!”  "}
{"text": "the Heretic Questioner shouted back like he was enjoying himself. The next moment, we once again  appeared behind the Golden Silk’s back. I struck my sword against her open back.  "}
{"text": "-Ugh!  The Golden Silk managed to stop my attack again. However, two unexpected ambushes were deadly.  Her stance faltered.  "}
{"text": "Whooosh!  "}
{"text": "She had originally intended to simply descend from the sky, but with her broken stance, she began to  fall.  -I don’t know what kind of trick you’re pulling, but it’s no use!  "}
{"text": "The Golden Silk shouted. The wind pressure from the fall messed up her golden hair.  "}
{"text": "-My body is invincible! Nothing can hurt me now! I am invincible! The Ox that Harvests Ruins gave me  a body that can never be scarred!  “Did you give up your soul because you didn’t want to get hurt?!”  "}
{"text": "-What do you care?!  The Golden Silk yelled angrily.  -Everyone only sees Raviel Ivansia! That annoying bitch! She was just born into a good family, and  "}
{"text": "then she acts tough like she understands all the sorrows of the world! I’ll kill her! I’ll steal everything  that bitch has!  A filthy and disgusting desire.  "}
{"text": "But I didn’t laugh at the Golden Silk. No matter how much one dressed it up, it was plain desire that  guided human beings. I knew because I had been the same.  "}
{"text": "But.  “TI know many people in the world who are worse off than you, lady of the barony!”  Thus, I had words that I could shout back.  "}
{"text": "I gripped the hilt of the Holy Sword more tightly.  “A person knows the pain he’s suffered! So when another screams in pain, he can imagine how lonely  "}
{"text": "it feels and sympathize! It doesn’t matter who you are! I feel for everyone who screams in pain!”  -Ha, don’t bullshit me! Who would live that kind of life?!  "}
{"text": "The Golden Silk mocked me. The wind grew stronger. Falling through the sky, she stared me down.  -You can’t hurt me anyway! My body is unyielding, unbreakable, and immortal!  That was right.  "}
{"text": "If she was someone who could change with just words, she would have already changed. Words were  powerless. You needed force to help someone who was screaming. That was why the doctrine of  shadows held their swords.  "}
{"text": "“Shiny!”  [Shiny responds to the warrior’s call.]  "}
{"text": "“Change from the Idol Sword to the Compassion Sword!”  As soon as I gave the order.  [Yes, warrior. ]  "}
{"text": "Black energy flowed from the Holy Sword. Gulp! The holy blade was soon contaminated with  blackness that was like dirty water.  "}
{"text": "My opponent’s abilities were powerful but simple.  [She bears one of Mutia’s blessings, [The Invulnerable Body]! ]  [She cannot be wounded. |  But I had a way to break her.  [My ability is pain. |  "}
{"text": "The sword that I got in Master’s world.  [The one who is cut by me feels pain. ]  [ But I do not leave a scar on their body nor kill them. |  [Suffering without injury is my ability. J  The second ability of the Guardian Goddess.  "}
{"text": "It was compassion.  “Sylvia Evanail!”  I cried out the real name of the Golden Silk and swung the sword.  “T will kill you!”  -Ha.  "}
{"text": "The Golden Silk scoffed. She seemed to have no intention to avoid my blow. Her face was daring me to  stab her somewhere. She had confidence in the blessing she had received. This absolute confidence was  holding her up.  "}
{"text": "-If you want to kill me, try...  The Golden Silk couldn’t finish her sentence.  "}
{"text": "Instead, she began to scream.  -Aaaaaaaah!!  "}
{"text": "The tip of my sword pierced through her heart. It left no scars. The blade simply went through the  Golden Silk’s chest as if there was nothing there. There was no blood.  -Kkgh, ha, eck?!  "}
{"text": "But there was pain.  -Aaaack! Aaaah!!  A bloody scream tore the red sky. Falling like a shooting star, the Golden Silk cried in pain. Her voice  "}
{"text": "spread past the wind and into the sunset.  “Heretic Questioner!”  "}
{"text": "We were falling from the sky. The ground was rapidly approaching. I stabbed the Golden SIIk’s heart  one more time.  "}
{"text": "And just before we fell to the ground—  “Now! ”  “Sacred Technique, Divine Transmission!”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner yelled like he had been waiting. He repeated the sacred technique several  times. Pop! Pop! With each teleportation, the speed of our fall gradually decreased. Finally, we landed  safely on the ground. We escaped from crashing.  "}
{"text": "However, the Golden Silk could not escape.  Booooom!  The ground shook as if a small meteorite had crashed. Dust rose up. Unlike last time, the Golden Silk’s  "}
{"text": "descent became a plunge. Nobody had been hurt by her hammer.  -Hick, hiik, kuk... This, ah...?  "}
{"text": "There was only an apostle who convulsed in pain from a pierced heart.  I fixed my grip on the sword.  “Does it hurt?”  "}
{"text": "Then, I slowly walked to the Golden Silk.  “T guess it must.”  "}
{"text": "Hearing my footsteps, the Golden Silk flinched. Sobbing and groaning, the Golden Silk shakingly  stood up.  -H-help!  "}
{"text": "The Golden Silk didn’t hear me. She only begged for rescue. Toward the evening sky. Toward the  puppets of the other Constellations.  "}
{"text": "-We had an agreement! I-it was a contract! Mutia won‘ forgive you if you just watch! Your  Constellation will be unhappy, too!  "}
{"text": "-Hm.  The general on the pegasus opened his mouth.  -That’s strange. A Constellation... no, it’s not. Is it a fragment of a Constellation? I can’t guess where  "}
{"text": "you found such an artifact, but—  The general slowly raised his flag.  -It doesn’t change that you are a disturbance I must subdue. Soldiers of the Warhorse. Awaken.  "}
{"text": "Then, the summons made themselves known.  "}
{"text": "-Guoooh!  Hundreds and thousands of ghosts appeared. In the light of the red sunset, the ghosts looked like  murderers covered in blood. Shocked screams erupted throughout the wedding venue.  "}
{"text": "The other’s ability was prodigious.  [The Sanctuary Battlefield is an area-of-effect blessing. It influences the whole field. J  [The effect is amazing. It [affixes the summoned being’s ability to its prime]. ]  "}
{"text": "[Each of those ghosts is an elite among elite soldier. They are the souls of the warriors who followed  Mahos! J  "}
{"text": "But I had a way to defeat it.  “Gongja,” said Raviel, coming up behind me. When I looked back, Raviel was holding something in  "}
{"text": "her hands.  “Wear this.”  It was a black cape.  "}
{"text": "Raviel put the cape around me like a scarf. Soon, my white tuxedo was hidden under the black cape.  And on the black expanse, the Ivansia coat of arms was embroidered with silver thread.  "}
{"text": "Meanwhile, the ghostly army drew nearer and nearer.  “D-Duchess Ivansia!”  "}
{"text": "The wedding guests who doubled as warriors looked at Raviel in confusion. Compared to last time,  they were better equipped and protected, but the march of the ghosts was horrifying.  “What should we do? Give us an order...”  "}
{"text": "“Shut up for now.”  Raviel responded to them briefly and finished equipping me with the cape. Her attitude showed that she  wasn’t worried about the ghostly legion.  "}
{"text": "“Hmm.”  She looked at my outfit and nodded.  "}
{"text": "“The cape also suits you well.”  “Thank you for granting my request. Still, I have to do this.”  “T understand. Finish it the way you want.”  "}
{"text": "“T will.”  I smiled and turned around.  "}

{"text": "-What...!  The general who spearheaded the charge on his pegasus stopped. The ghosts following him also  "}
{"text": "stopped. The attack that had so confidently tried to overwhelm us was blocked by a shadow that buried  the ground.  “My lord.”  "}
{"text": "One of the shadows opened her mouth.  “Did you call me?”  Preta knelt on one knee.  "}
{"text": "Her appearance was different from usual. She wasn’t in the delicate form of Estelle. A dark red  substance endlessly oozed from Preta’s body. This form was that of the [Devil King of Fall Rain],  whom I had once fought.  "}
{"text": "[It affixes the summoned being’s abilities to its prime. ]  It wasn’t just Preta.  "}
{"text": "Behind her stood warriors in dark robes. Each had a different face, origin, and life, but they were united  under the color black.  "}
{"text": "“We greet the Infernal Heavens’ Young Master!”  They were those who proved my life.  In the black cloak, I said, “Please fight for me.”  "}

{"text": "Each shadow wore a fluttering black robe. The shadows weren’t surprised at all by the army of  phantoms that stood a distance away. After all, they had lived in a world overrun by Jiangshi and  experienced death.  "}
{"text": "It was impossible for them to fear ghosts.  "}
{"text": "“You look very fine today, Young Master,” the Flame Ghost Demon said in a carefree tone. He was the  first-ranked of the Demonic Sect’s Four Demon Lords, a cultist who competed against the Shaolin  temple’s chief monk in the Great Battle of Good and Evil.  "}
{"text": "“You’ve even put powder on your face. Just like a groom-to-be.”  I nodded. “That’s right. I’m getting married.”  “...What?”  "}
{"text": "A thousand cult members turned their heads in unison. They were martial artists who had regained the  abilities of their prime. Everyone must have been listening to me by augmenting their hearing with  their internal energy.  "}
{"text": "So that they could all hear me, I enunciated my words. “I am getting married today.”  Silence fell.  The cult members looked at each other. Then they looked back at me. They were trying to poke and see  "}
{"text": "if I was serious or just joking. I responded to their query with a simple nod.  “Y-Young Master is—” the Flame Ghost Demon opened his mouth. “Young Master is going to wed!”  The Demonic Cultists freaked.  "}
{"text": "“Our young master is tying the knot!”  “The greatest follower of the Demonic path is getting married!”  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s not just an engagement! It’s an actual marriage!”  The cult members forgot about the ghost legion in front of them and began to rampage. They howled  "}
{"text": "and roared. It was like they urgently had to announce my marriage to the world.  “Who is your partner?!”  "}
{"text": "“She’s over there.” I politely indicated toward Raviel with both hands. “The one over there with silver  hair will be my husband.”  "}
{"text": "Raviel was calming the imperial citizens who had fallen into confusion.  As always, her profile was cool and dashing.  The jaws of the cult members who followed my hand gesture and turned their heads fell to the ground.  "}
{"text": "“She’s beautiful...”  “L-lovely indeed.”  “Our young master has good tastes.”  "}
{"text": "“Young Master! What level of internal energy has Madam achieved?”  Someone asked about her skill in martial arts, thinking she might not be strong.  "}
{"text": "“Mm. My husband doesn’t know martial arts.”  The cult members’ eyes opened wide. Whispers of discontent quickly spread through the hall. The  cultists’ eyes rebelled, unable to accept this marriage.  "}
{"text": "“But, she’s the person who will accompany you in the Demonic path...”  “Isn’t it kind of, you know, if she doesn’t know any martial arts?”  "}
{"text": "“Mm. Authority always comes from physical strength...”  “The Blood Guard cannot accept this union!”  I added, “I forgot to tell you. My partner is second only to the emperor in this land.”  "}
{"text": "Then, the cultists quieted.  “That’s a different story, then...”  “Tt’s not like people have to learn martial arts. Right?”  "}
{"text": "“Yup, authority comes from political strength...”  “Congratulations on your wedding! Young Master!”  "}
{"text": "These people were very innocent in many ways.  However, not all of those present were part of the Demonic Cult. Preta, who was once called the Devil  King of Fall Rain and feared by the world, had been dumbfounded as soon as I shared that I was  "}
{"text": "getting married.  “M-milord is getting married?”  “Yea. It turned out like that.”  "}
{"text": "“Tt doesn’t make sense. A nutjob like milord... Ah, no, I apologize. Does a human who wants to marry  such a unique person as milord actually exist?”  "}
{"text": "Preta, you...  You keep saying milord this, milord that, when on the inside you think of me as a nutjob...  "}
{"text": "I sighed as another scar was added to my heart.  “She really exists, yes. We can talk in more detail at the reception. For now, focus on the battle.”  “Uh, ah. Yes. I understand, milord. What kind of enemy is it...?”  "}
{"text": "“They’re apostles from other worlds who have come to conquer this one.” Then, I added, “They’re also  trying to wreck my wedding.”  "}
{"text": "As soon as the words left my mouth, the cultists’ mood changed.  “Oho.”  "}
{"text": "The Blood Demon, head of the Blood Guard, touched the hilt of his sword.  “Hmm...”  The head of the Memorial Squadron, the Flame Ghost Demon, smirked.  "}
{"text": "“They dare interrupt the wedding of the Demonic Sect’s young master.”  Demon Lord Wolyeong, leader of the Shadow Corpse Squadron, brushed back his hair.  "}
{"text": "“Ha. They’re mad.”  The Sword Demon, leader of the Assassination Squad, twisted his neck up and down, left and right.  "}
{"text": "Lastly, Preta pulled out her sword without a word. It was a magical sword that emitted dark red rays,  the same sword that had killed me hundreds of times.  “T see. I understand now. I thought that milord underwent another awakening that helped us gain the  "}
{"text": "strength we had in our lives... But that’s not it. It’s a Constellation’s blessing. Those men are the pawns  of a Constellation.”  “That’s right.”  "}
{"text": "“May I ask what Constellations these children are mooching off of?”  “Mahos. Also known as the Warhorse of the Eternal Plains.”  The tip of Preta’s mouth twisted.  "}
{"text": "“They’re idiots who only know how to fight.”  Her derision was reminiscent of the arrogance she had before she fell to me.  "}
{"text": "The enemy numbered 10,000. We were only one thousand. However, the cult members chatted and  readied their blades, and Preta slowly raised her sword. Our side had the advantage; nobody thought  otherwise.  "}
{"text": "None of us.  “My lord, please give us our orders. What do you want me to do?”  "}
{"text": "I gave the order.  “Wipe them out.”  "}
{"text": "Preta raised her demonic sword high.  “As you wish.”  "}
{"text": "First guard.  A ray that was even redder than blood split the already red sky.  -Guoooh!  "}
{"text": "Power and dignity filled Preta’s strike, for she would allow nothing else. The ghosts who were caught  in the red ray screamed and ceased to exist.  "}
{"text": "Even the general who led the ghost legion was nearly beaten.  -What, this is... No, it doesn’t make sense. A Constellation...? He’s not a Constellation himself, but he  had one as a subordinate...  "}
{"text": "While the general looked at me in astonishment—  “Beat ’em up!”  "}
{"text": "—the Demonic sect members burst into a wild roar.  “They’re small fry! You don’t even have to say our sect’s chant!”  "}
{"text": "“You fucking plebs think you can interfere with a marriage of the Demonic Sect?!”  “The necks we snap today are our wedding gifts for the Young Master! Understand? Anyone who kills  less than five will die by my hands today!”  "}
{"text": "“Kuhaha! The Assassination Squad will get at least ten each!”  “This is why unlearned idiots are...”  "}
{"text": "Some raged, some howled, and some clicked their tongues. The legion of ghosts was still far away, but  the distance meant nothing. A thousand shadows utilized the Lightness Skill to stride forward at once.  "}
{"text": "-Huuh?! Stop them!  The general shouted, flustered.  The ghost legion definitely comprised elite soldiers. The ghosts lifted their shields and formed ranks at  "}
{"text": "once, not having a single gap between them. With their spears raised up, they looked like a giant  porcupine. But.  “Fools.” Preta, the specter of Fall Rain, laughed at them. “The cannon fodder made themselves into  "}
{"text": "targets.”  A red ray ripped through the sky again. Ba-ba-bang! The tightly packed ghost legion was easily swept  away. A gaping hole was poked in their formation. Other ghosts hurriedly tried to fill the gap.  "}
{"text": "“Kahaha!”  However, the cult members, with their honed fighting instincts, would never neglect an opening.  “Tear them apart!”  "}
{"text": "The cultists rushed in like beasts. The army of shadows and the army of ghosts clashed. Chwak!  Chwaaak! The cultists spread their chi and slaughtered the ghosts.  "}
{"text": "Unlike the Battle of Good and Evil, they didn’t bother shouting their rallying cry of “Baraya.” No one  mentioned why, but I could guess the reason. This wasn’t a duel. It wasn’t a great war.  "}
{"text": "It was simply a hunt.  The cultists saw the ghost legion as mere beasts and slayed them.  -Kigeeek!  "}
{"text": "The ghost legion couldn’t refute their arrogant view. The legion’s ranks were destroyed by the cultists’  swords. Their shields and their spears fell apart. The cultists stabbed their swords through the cracks of  the broken shields and grabbed the other end of the spears to pierce the ghosts.  "}
{"text": "It was a massacre.  -Units, regroup!  The general raised his flag and yelled urgently.  "}
{"text": "-Warriors, do not panic! There is no hurry! Heed your unit leaders’ commands...  “Oi.”  Plop.  "}
{"text": "Someone nimbly jumped on top of the general’s flag.  “Hiya.”  "}
{"text": "Sword Demon. He was the first-ranked man among the Four Demon Lords and the one with the foulest  mouth. The Sword Demon’s face was covered in the shade, his back against the evening sunset.  "}
{"text": "“Bruh, you’re messing with our young master’s wedding?”  -You—  “Fucking bitch. Just drop dead.”  "}
{"text": "Weapons flashed. One blow. Two. Three. Three strikes intertwined like a spider web. The first blow cut  the general’s right arm, the second cut his chest, and the third shredded the flag.  -C-cough...  "}
{"text": "The apostle of the military god spat out blood. That only lasted a moment. The Sword Demon made a  final strike to the throat from which the general vomited blood. The man’s scream was cut short as his  head flew off.  "}
{"text": "“Oof.”  The Sword Demon jumped up the flagpole. He caught the general’s head as it soared through the air.  "}
{"text": "“Aigo, I can’t drop this precious thing. Kaha. You see that, brats? I’m the Sword Demon, head of the  Assasination Squad! Our squad takes the cake when it comes to the wedding gifts for our young  master!”  "}
{"text": "“Damn it.”  “Why did that blockhead...”  "}
{"text": "All over the battlefield, there were quiet exclaims of “fuck.” Did the Four Demon Lords feel some  weird competitive spirit? The other cultists looked sour, saying that the Sword Demon stole a good  prize.  "}
{"text": "[The apostle of ‘The Warhorse of the Eternal Plains’ has died.]  Srrk—  The general’s head, which the Sword Demon had taken, turned into light and disappeared. And that  "}
{"text": "wasn’t all. His beheaded body and the ghosts that followed the general disappeared like dust in an  instant. The whole legion disappeared.  “Huh? Huuuh?”  "}
{"text": "The Sword Demon was bewildered. He looked at his right hand, which had suddenly become empty.  After a moment, he looked blankly at me.  "}
{"text": "“Uh... Uuh... It’s the thought that counts, right? Young Master?”  I smirked.  “Tt’s all right. I’ll cut you a break.”  "}
{"text": "It was then.  -Lu. La.  "}
{"text": "The apostles of [The Evangelist of Everlasting Happiness], who still remained, began to sing. Lu. La.  The children held hands and danced circles in the air. With every step in the sunset, more melody filled  the sky.  "}
{"text": "“Hmm.”  “Uh ”  "}
{"text": "The cultists frowned. Some tried to hurriedly fight the song with their chi, but they failed. When the  apostle of [The Warhorse of the Eternal Plains] died, the area-wide effect also ended.  “Ah...”  "}
{"text": "Preta also moaned dejectedly. The black substance that covered her body soon drained away. Preta  clicked her tongue and looked at the Sword Demon.  "}
{"text": "“That stupid... He’s on our side, but he’s no help. I’m sorry, milord. If I was in my prime, I could fight  against a psychological attack like... this weak, um... fight it... it...”  "}
{"text": "Preta’s voice became slower as she went on because she had fallen asleep. Preta’s body swayed.  It wasn’t just her. The cultists who ran madly through the battlefield a little while ago collapsed one by  one. The wedding guests under Raviel’s command were the same. Humans were helpless to the lullaby  "}
{"text": "sung by the apostles of dreams.  “Please wait, Death King.”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner made some hand signs.  “T’ll create a field of immunity!”  “No need.”  "}
{"text": "I caught the Heretic Questioner’s hands to stop him. The Heretic Questioner tilted his head.  “Death King? If we stay like this, even we’ll fall to the apostles’ song.”  “Maybe so. But if I’m right, Raviel, you, and I will be fine. Though, I don’t know about the others.”  "}
{"text": "“Hmm.”  The Heretic Questioner smiled and dropped his hands.  “Got it. If Death King says so, you must have a reason.”  "}
{"text": "The sunset reached its apex.  -Lu. La, la.  "}
{"text": "-La, lulu. Lu.  The sunset glowed red and shined on the children. Their shadows extended to the horizon. The  shadows on the ground came closer and farther, smaller and larger, again and again.  "}
{"text": "[It’s a psychological attack. J  [ Those who are exposed to the song are forcibly pushed into their happiest memory. |  The wedding hall became quiet.  "}
{"text": "The cultists sat on the ground, sleeping as they leaned on each other’s shoulders. Some wedding guests  were even lying down and sleeping. Was everyone trapped in their own happiness?  "}
{"text": "“Hmm.”  However, three people could still speak.  “You were right.”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner stroked his chin like he found it all interesting. He looked back and forth at  Raviel and me.  "}
{"text": "“The three of us are fine, just like Death King said. I do feel a little drowsy, but my body’s condition is  normal. Aha. What kind of magic did you use this time, Death King?”  There were others apart from the Heretic Questioner who were curious about the situation. The apostles  "}
{"text": "of dreams slowly stopped their dance. The children tilted their heads and looked down at me.  -You’re a weird human.  "}
{"text": "-He won‘ fall asleep. Don’t you dream?  -You don’t have any happy memories?  I shook my head.  "}
{"text": "“No.”  I slowly looked around the wedding hall.  “Tt’s not like that.”  "}
{"text": "There, Preta was breathing quietly as she slept. Cultists dozed off, leaning back-to-back. A life that I  took and lives that were evidence of my master.  "}
{"text": "I had many reasons to be unhappy.  Countless reasons.  I had been burned to death, killed myself thousands of times, and witnessed my colleagues killing each  "}
{"text": "other out of suspicion. There were even times when I had to die a dozen deaths just to take one step  forward. A corpse had ripped out my throat, and I had to let go of someone who called me beautiful.  Nobody would blame me if I said my life was a tragedy.  "}
{"text": "“I’m the happiest right now.”  But the person I loved was here.  "}
{"text": "One reason to be happy was more precious to me than hundreds of reasons to be sad.  “T don’t know if you know, but today is my wedding day. I don’t know about any other day, but for  today, it’ll be hard to find someone happier than I am. You just chose the wrong date to invade this  "}
{"text": "world.”  I shrugged.  "}
{"text": "“As for the Heretic Questioner... Well, either he’s never felt happiness or he’s simply happy every  day.”  "}
{"text": "“Ah. Indeed! That must be it. I’m definitely happy all the time! You’ve seen right through me, Death  King.”  The Heretic Questioner laughed and whispered,  "}
{"text": "“Sacred Technique. Divine Transmission.”  "}
{"text": "The next moment, we were transported to the apostles’ back.  Unlike the other apostles, the apostles of [The Evangelist of Everlasting Happiness] had no skill in  fighting. The apostles in the form of children did not fight back when they saw us. They just stared up  "}
{"text": "at my face.  -You’re a weird human.  "}
{"text": "Mind set, I swung my sword.  [The apostle of ‘The Evangelist of Everlasting Happiness’ has died. ]  Then, we returned to the ground with the sacred technique.  "}
{"text": "We had subjugated all of the foreign beings who had invaded this world.  Actually, not yet.  I fixed my grip on the Holy Sword and looked back. An apostle with a large hammer stood in the  "}
{"text": "distance. As her eyes met mine, she cowered back.  -Sob, aah... Ah...  I slowly opened my mouth.  "}
{"text": "“This is your last chance to fight me. It’s your last chance to counter me and your last chance to resist. I  will kill you and reap your soul.”  "}
{"text": "-R-reap...?  “You don’t need to understand now. You’!l know soon enough.”  I pointed my sword at the apostle of the hammer.  "}

{"text": "Human beings are limited when they are cornered. A person’s mind and thinking rapidly become  constricted. So, humans can escape, or they can cling to someone. The Golden Silk was no different.  "}
{"text": "-I-in return... That’s right. In return, I will dedicate my being to you! No, I will wreck this world, just as  you desire! Ruins! Wreckage! Destruction! Mutia loves these things, right?! I’m good at it! Things like  that!  "}
{"text": "Tap. I took a step forward.  -Hiik.  The Golden Silk became more frantic when she heard my footsteps. She backpedaled. As she jumped  "}
{"text": "back, she looked up at the bright red sky as if salvation would come for her even now.  -I-I’m good at it! Lord Mutia! If it’s just smashing things, I’m really...!  But there was no response.  "}
{"text": "-This is—  Prayer quickly soured to resentment.  "}
{"text": "-This is a breach of our contract!!  I stepped closer.  "}
{"text": "-You gave me the power to forge a new destiny! But why?! Why is there some weird, crazy bitch in my  body?! Give it back! Give me back my body!  “Ah. You’re wrong,” the Heretic Questioner said happily.  "}
{"text": "“If you’re talking about me, I’m sorry, but I’m physically male! So, your words are wrong! You need to  say I’m a [crazy bastard], not a [crazy bitch], to be precise. Well, to speak more properly, you should  say I am a [crazy person]! Healthy words are the root of a healthy mind, Miss Evanail!”  "}
{"text": "-Asshole!  The Lady of the Golden Silk, no, Sylvia Evanail yelled.  "}
{"text": "-This is wrong! Yeah, it’s wrong! It’s a breach of contract... I was going to be an empress. I was going  to rise to a better position than Raviel Ivansia. That’s what was supposed to happen! That’s my fate.  The fate that I made! So... So, you’re breaking the contract... I—  "}
{"text": "One more step.  -Ugh!  "}
{"text": "Only then did Sylvia Evanail turn her eyes from the sky. I was too close for her to keep ignoring me.  -You monster!  Sylvia Evanail swung her hammer. Clank! The hammer and the Holy Sword clashed. Sylvia Evanail  "}
{"text": "smashed down the hammer without hesitation; I easily stepped away and countered. As we continued to  fight, Sylvia Evanail became increasingly impatient.  An impatient mind was easy to break.  "}
{"text": "-Ah—  I had been aiming for the opening created by Sylvia Evanail’s large swing. I cut through her wrist.  -Aaaaaaaah!!  "}
{"text": "Of course, there were no wounds. No bloodstains, not even a speck. There was no red color that  testified to her pain, but Sylvia Evanail screamed like she was being torn apart.  "}
{"text": "She lost her grip on the hammer. Thump! The hammer fell to the ground with a heavy thud.  -Ah, ouch... Ahhh...  I met Sylvia Evanail’s eyes. The dust from the hammer’s impact rose up to our knees.  "}
{"text": "“Choose.”  -Ch-choose...?  "}
{"text": "“You’ve already lost your place in this world. Even if you run away like this, you’re no longer the  [Lady of the Golden Silk]. You’re nothing more than a Constellation’s apostle.”  “T’Il give you an opportunity.”  "}
{"text": "Sylvia Evanail held her wrist and glared at me.  “Tf you want to remain as a servant of the Constellation, do whatever you want. Run away. I’ll let you  go. But if you have any lingering attachments to this world, if you want to stay here and do something  "}
{"text": "else, give up your Constellation’s blessing.”  -Why would I...  “And die by my sword.”  "}
{"text": "I pointed my sword at her.  “You must have seen the battle just now. I can summon those who die by my hand with all their  memories from life. Sylvia Evanail. If you surrender, I will summon you in this world so you can once  "}
{"text": "again live as the [Lady of the Golden Silk].”  “Of course, your life won’t be the same as before. Any acts against my lover, Raviel Ivansia, are  forbidden. But that’s all. The rest, you can do as you wish. You can choose to marry the prince and live  "}
{"text": "as you please.”  -Why...?  “Because you need to live again.”  "}
{"text": "The sky was now mixing purple into the red. In the empire, weddings lasted from the moment the sky  turned orange to the moment the sun disappeared. I guessed that we had less than 30 minutes left.  "}
{"text": "-How... can I trust you? W-what if you treat me like a slave after summoning me? I won’t be able to  rebel or resist.  "}
{"text": "“Think about it.”  I looked at Sylvia Evanail.  “Why were the bodies of ‘you’ and ‘your butler’ chosen to be possessed?”  "}
{"text": "-Huh?  “You gave everything to a Constellation to make your wish come true. Your memory, your body—  everything was given to your Constellation. That’s why there was a gap in this world where your place  "}
{"text": "should have been.”  Anybody could have taken her place.  "}
{"text": "That was probably how the [Comer Librarian] had the Heretic Questioner and me possess these bodies.  “Tt’s understandable why your spot was left empty.”  However.  "}
{"text": "“Have you ever thought about why your butler’s space was, too?”  Sylvia Evanail raised her eyes sharply.  "}
{"text": "“T don’t know the details, but I became the butler once. I was completely immersed in his life. What I  realized then was that this man was purely and ardently devoted to you, Sylvia Evanail.”  With that, I could infer what had happened.  "}
{"text": "“T guarantee that you would never have been happy, even if you were the empress.”  -What...?  “You said so earlier. You don’t want to be the empress because you love the prince but because you  "}
{"text": "want to be better than Raviel. Do you think your life would go smoothly if you became the empress  that way?”  I shook my head.  "}
{"text": "“You’re quite capable but not as much as Raviel. Your family doesn’t have the power and dignity of the  Ivansias. You don’t have Raviel’s ability to lead and command a crowd. After you become empress,  people will never stop comparing you to Raviel and putting you down.”  "}
{"text": "“For the rest of your life.”  Let’s say this.  "}
{"text": "Say that there was a butler.  The butler watched his master suffer for her entire life.  "}
{"text": "“The butler I know is a man who is willing to give up everything to save you.”  The butler would have thought:  [The Lady of the Golden Silk would have been happy if only she hadn’t been the empress. ]  “This is what I believe.”  "}
{"text": "-My butler... My butler regressed?  “No.”  "}
{"text": "The butler wasn’t a regressor.  “You made a wish for yourself. But that wasn’t what the butler did. He made a wish for your sake. He  didn’t want to redo his life. He only wanted you to go back.”  "}
{"text": "-What do you mean...?  “You. Do you remember your butler’s name?”  "}
{"text": "-Huh?  Sylvia Evanail frowned.  -Of course. My butler’s name is...  "}
{"text": "However.  -...Huh?  "}
{"text": "Sylvia Evanail couldn’t say his name. Her eyebrows furrowed even more. After a while, her frown  dropped a bit. Sylvia Evanail’s gaze drifted into the air, flustered.  "}
{"text": "-W-wait. This can’t be. Ah? ...Uh? Uhh...?  I calmly watched Sylvia Evanail.  That was right.  "}
{"text": "In this world, the butler had never been called by name.  Not even Sylvia Evanail called him by his name. He was her one and only butler and childhood friend,  but she only called him ‘butler.’ There was no need to call him that when they were alone in her  "}
{"text": "quarters.  f Butler. J  "}
{"text": "Raviel Ivansia also never called the butler by name. All the information in the empire was within her  grasp, so she couldn’t be unaware of someone so close to the Lady of the Golden Silk.  "}

{"text": "I couldn’t remember or recall it at all.  Sylvia Evanail’s expression crumbled.  -Then, what...?  Just like a sturdy tower crumbling from the top.  -Are you... saying that the butler is gone?  "}
{"text": "“Yes.”  Most likely.  This world had regressed three times.  First, Sylvia Evanail wished to a Constellation to return to her past.  The Constellation who granted her wish was [The Ox that Harvests Ruins].  "}
{"text": "The Constellation who governed destruction and re-creation granted Sylvia Evanail another life.  Sylvia Evanail beat Raviel in becoming the empress.  Then, the ‘butler’ made a wish to another Constellation.  The Constellation who granted his wish... I’m not sure who it was.  "}
{"text": "The butler devoted all of himself to the Golden Silk, and as a result, the world returned to its former  state, to the time before the Lady of the Golden Silk married the crown prince. To the past when  nothing had been decided yet.  "}
{"text": "Finally, Raviel caused a regression.  The Constellation who granted her wish was a fragment of the [Guardian Goddess].  "}
{"text": "Because of this regression, the world was trapped in ten days, looping forever.  And it finally caught up to now.  “We can’t learn the butler’s name. Ever.”  "}
{"text": "“What was the butler thinking as he served you his whole life? What was he thinking when he prayed  for you to return, sacrificing his everything? We can never know. Because he’s gone.”  "}
{"text": "But.  “The butler would have wanted you to live a different life.”  And that was why.  "}
{"text": "“T want to grant the butler’s wish.”  “Sylvia Evanail. In a time you don’t know, someone whose name you don’t know sacrificed himself for  "}

{"text": "“Live again.”  It wasn’t too late yet.  “Live again like he wanted you to.”  "}
{"text": "Sylvia Evanail said nothing.  Her hands trembled. She opened her mouth and closed it again, not saying a word. Her vocal cords  "}

{"text": "Stage cleared.  It meant that this world, [The Tale of Sormwyn Academy], had officially become a part of our Tower.  Hunters could now come and go from this world.  "}
{"text": "However, they of course could not enter freely. They needed to be judged by the great guilds. For  example, a regular Hunter needed a permit to enter the Aegim empire.  "}
{"text": "What I mean is—  Pop!  Shortly after the stage clearing was announced, a white light flashed. Pop! Pop! Light burst from all  "}
{"text": "over the wedding hall. It was the sight of Hunters being transported to the floor.  “Death King! No, Kim Gongja! You!”  As the lights faded, I saw some familiar faces.  "}
{"text": "“How could you get married without consulting us?!”  Some people could travel between floors without a permit. For example, the heads of the great guilds.  One of them, the Rank 2 Hunter Black Dragon Master, was flushed red.  "}
{"text": "“I’m against this wedding!!”  "}
{"text": "“Death King is a Hunter representing our Tower! Obviously, the wedding should be held on the first  floor of our Tower, the city of Babylon, not here! We have to broadcast it all over the world! It’s  invalid! This wedding totally doesn’t count!”  "}
{"text": "The Black Dragon Master wasn’t the only one with something to say.  “Ahem. Hm. Death King.”  The Rank 1 Hunter. The Sword Saint cleared his throat.  "}
{"text": "“First of all, congratulations on clearing the stage. Truthfully... It was an extremely fast-paced  romance. No, I know it’s rude to talk about this here, but as an old man, I’d like to say one thing—”  “Don’t. ”  "}
{"text": "“Mm ”  The Sword Saint closed his mouth. These days, he seemed to be recovering from his boomer mindset.  "}
{"text": "“There was an uproar while you were challenging this stage. Why in the world did you two fall in love?  Despite everything, Death King, I stood firmly on your side. Only those who have experienced love at  first sight can understand. You needn’t worry. I understand. Trust me, I’ll placate the Black Dragon  Master.”  "}
{"text": "Then, for some reason, the Crusader gruffly put her nose in the air. Her glance seemed to imply, ‘I  understand everything about your love.’ I didn’t know what she meant.  "}
{"text": "I turned to Raviel.  “Hmm.”  "}
{"text": "Raviel was expressionless. At first glance, that is. | could understand her seemingly expressionless look  because I loved her.  Raviel was... watching the Black Dragon Master and company with great interest. Her red eyes were  "}
{"text": "overflowing with curiosity.  “Gongja. My love.”  "}
{"text": "“Yes, my love...?”  “There seems to be a lot of people you need to introduce to me.”  Yeah...  "}
{"text": "It was a little late, but it was time for her to meet my family.  6.  "}
{"text": "I did think about having her meet everyone before the marriage, but the culture here was different. In  the empire, it was common for families to be formally introduced to each other after their union.  “Tsn’t it natural?”  "}
{"text": "Raviel tilted her head.  “Many family members live far away from the main residence. The wedding ceremony is what invites  and gathers them together. On the night after the wedding ceremony, the families of the bride and  "}
{"text": "groom finally greet each other.”  “Oh... That’s certainly true.”  I was immediately convinced.  "}
{"text": "Well, yeah. Marriage was also a union between families. Hunters like us, who fled from the outside  world, can’t really talk about family, but... The empire was different. There was a greater importance  on the family than on the individual.  "}
{"text": "And this wedding ceremony didn’t just symbolize a union of families.  A marriage of nations. No, it was a marriage of worlds.  "}
{"text": "Representing the empire was Raviel. Representing the Tower was me. Since it was our marriage.  “Hoho...”  "}
{"text": "The grand chamberlain, my adoptive father, maintained his wry smile.  “T never imagined such an occasion... I’ve already sent so many messenger birds to the emperor today.  I don’t know what to tell him now.”  "}
{"text": "“Yes. This was unexpected for us as well,”  "}
{"text": "said the Black Dragon Master. She was extremely calm, as if she hadn’t been agitated a few moments  ago. The powerful people of the empire and the Tower sat side by side at a table, guarded against each  other but both taken aback.  "}
{"text": "“But rather than a misfortune, it was a stroke of luck. Lord Chamberlain, it is fortunate that our first  meeting with you is during a wedding.”  Then, they leaped over the wariness and embarrassment and continued to talk.  "}
{"text": "“You’re saying that your people come from another world, correct? It’s a strange affair that is difficult  enough to explain to His Majesty, let alone his subjects.”  "}
{"text": "“Yes, you’re right. I understand well your empire’s situation.”  The Black Dragon Master nodded. She seemed familiar with acting in a diplomatic capacity. She knew  "}
{"text": "well how to walk the line between competency and politeness.  “However, Lord Chamberlain must have seen the invasion of beings from other worlds. If a person  denies the truth, then one day the truth will deny the person. I am concerned about that future.”  "}
{"text": "“Mm. You speak truly.”  "}
{"text": "“Thank you. Lord Chamberlain, what we must do from now is to reach a common understanding. For  five years, ten, twenty, or perhaps even more...”  Both sides spoke calmly.  "}
{"text": "Raviel had control over the empire’s people, and I had the complete trust of the Tower’s top rankers.  Our marriage was of great fortune for both sides.  "}
{"text": "It’s normally difficult to physically gather people of power from opposite sides, but the wedding  between Raviel and me took care of that arduous task from the get-go. Our negotiations couldn’t have  had a better start than this.  "}
{"text": "I was sitting in the seats of honor with Raviel. Reaching under the table, I held Raviel’s hand. Tightly.  Raviel naturally intertwined her fingers with mine.  "}
{"text": "That one gesture made me relax. The night was long. The stars were bright. The candlelight on the  table flickered, and between the candles, people spoke.  Suddenly, everything was beautiful.  "}
{"text": "“Raviel.”  “Speak.”  "}
{"text": "A quiet whisper.  “There are a few others I want to introduce to you.”  “Other than those here?”  "}
{"text": "“Yes.”  “Then we should go see them.”  "}
{"text": "Raviel stood up from her seat.  The empire’s people immediately stopped talking.  "}
{"text": "“The night is still long. Continue speaking with the others. I’m briefly leaving to meet my wife’s  people.”  No one could stop Raviel from leaving. As expected of the Duchess of Ivansia. If going when one  "}
{"text": "wanted was proof of one’s power, then my husband had unparalleled power here.  I took Raviel to where the Demonic Cult members were sitting.  “Oh. Young Master! You’re a newlywed now!”  "}
{"text": "The Sword Demon raised his glass and laughed gleefully. All of the cult members were drunk from the  alcohol served at the wedding. When they saw me, they tried to stand up to greet us, but I waved my  hand. The cultists then bowed in their seated positions.  "}
{"text": "“Congratulations!”  “Many blessings to you, Young Master!”  "}
{"text": "“The alcohol here tastes unique and delicious!”  “Long live the Demonic Cult!”  “Phew! You two really look good together!”  "}
{"text": "The wedding hall became noisy at once. It couldn’t be helped with a thousand Demonic Cult members  causing a ruckus. I smiled wryly.  "}
{"text": "“Sword Demon. Come here.”  “Ves?”  "}
{"text": "The Sword Demon blinked, still holding a wine glass. He looked dopey, like he didn’t expect to be  called out by me. The drunk cultists around him howled in laughter.  “Look at that! I knew he’d get scolded by the young master one day!”  "}
{"text": "“He forgets to speak politely whenever the young master calls. Fool.”  “Kick his ass, Young Master!”  “Uh... Uuuhbh...”  "}
{"text": "The Sword Demon put down his glass and hesitantly approached us. His brashness from when he  beheaded the general of the ghost legion had completely disappeared. He shrank in on himself like a  child who had done something wrong.  "}
{"text": "“S-sorry. Young Master. I never had much learning, so I don’t know how to speak politely very well.  But in my mind, I still look up to Young Master...”  "}
{"text": "The Sword Demon who laid out many excuses.  I put my hand on his shoulder.  “Raviel.”  "}
{"text": "Then, I said to my bride,  “This is the Sword Demon.”  "}
{"text": "“He’s a subordinate of my master. My master was the head of a group called the Demonic Sect. She  selected four outstanding people from among the cult and called them the Four Demon Lords. The  Sword Demon is one of them.”  "}
{"text": "“Oho.”  Raviel glanced at the Sword Demon. The Sword Demon squirmed.  "}
{"text": "“A simple man. Your speech is rough, and your attitude is poor. My wife’s master must not have judged  a person for their speech or attitude. Since she found you from a rough and poor place, you must be  someone precious and noble.”  "}
{"text": "“T am Raviel Ivansia. I am a duchess of the empire and the spouse of the one you call Young Master. I  hope we’|l get along well.”  “Y-yes. Let’s... get along.”  "}
{"text": "I turned my head.  “Demon Lord Wolyeong.”  "}
{"text": "“Come here.”  Someone stood up from the center of the group. He bowed his head politely.  "}
{"text": "“Yes, Young Master.”  A strange silence settled over the night air. The small talk that had been happening while they drank  had died down. I called each of the Four Demon Lords, one by one, and each time, the demon lord was  "}
{"text": "very polite.  Then, I called the next person I wanted to introduce.  “Preta.”  "}
{"text": "“.,. Yes, milord.”  “Come here.”  "}
{"text": "“Yes.”  Preta, who had been mixed among the cultists, stood up. Perhaps she had been waiting for my  summons as she had tidied her outfit.  "}
{"text": "“This child’s name is... Preta,”  I said.  "}
{"text": "“Preta was originally born as a nameless monster. She was a doppelganger. She could imitate whatever  she ate. Preta ate beasts such as frogs and snakes at first, but accidentally, she came to eat humans.  Then...”  "}
{"text": "Preta quietly kept her head down. Sometimes, her shoulders would shake a little. The strange silence  persisted.  "}
{"text": "In introducing their lives, I also introduced mine.  One person told another about his life. Softly. Under the night sky. It was a sacred act in itself.  “And... Ah. Right.”  "}
{"text": "I unfastened the Holy Sword from my waist holster.  “This is Shiny.”  “Shiny?”  "}
{"text": "“Yes. She had a more lofty name at first. She was tricked by a bad man and was sealed into a sword.  Her real name, the [Guardian Goddess], seemed like a waste, so I just nicknamed her Shiny. Since, you  know, she’s shiny... Very shiny...”  "}
{"text": "“T see.”  Raviel laughed a little.  "}
{"text": "“My wife’s naming sense is rather severe. Merciless. If it were me, I would at least have called her  Hui.”[1]  "}
{"text": "[Shiny swears allegiance to the warrior’s partner! |  Shiny was quick to change loyalties.  "}
{"text": "“Mm.”  And.  "}
{"text": "“You can’t see him here... but I have a friend.”  Bae Hu-ryeong.  “Raviel, you may never see him. You can’t meet him either... My friend’s circumstances are a bit  "}
{"text": "peculiar. He can’t show himself to others.”  My partner.  "}
{"text": "“His way of speaking is totally vulgar, yeah. It’s about 30 times worse than the Sword Demon. But he’s  really strong. Incredibly strong... He was the first to teach me the sword, and he taught me to use aura  as well.”  "}
{"text": "“Oho. He’s an important person.”  Bae Hu-ryeong was silent.  "}
{"text": "He was wearing a shabby martial arts uniform. His arms were folded.  Instead of running his mouth as usual, Bae Hu-ryeong silently looked at Raviel and me.  “_,.Without this friend, I don’t think I could have endured my time alone.”  "}
{"text": "“Ts that so?”  “Yes.”  “Then, I must express my gratitude to that friend.”  "}
{"text": "Raviel bowed her head.  To the empty space in which she could see nothing.  "}
{"text": "“Meeting Gongja made me happy. If this friend hadn’t helped Gongja, my happiness would never have  come to be. Thank you for everything you’ve done for Gongja so he could be here now.”  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong slowly opened his mouth.  -Yeah. Please take care of this crazy kid.  I spoke for him.  "}
{"text": "“If that friend heard Raviel’s words, he would have said to take care of me because I’m nuts.”  “You have a wonderful friend.”  I took a deep breath.  "}
{"text": "“Raviel.”  This.  "}
{"text": "“This is my everything.”  Everything I love.  "}
{"text": "Everyone who opened and entered the door to my heart.  My family.  Raviel held my hand firmly.  "}
{"text": "“My love.”  “Yes.”  "}
{"text": "“Let’s dance.”  There was an intense passion in Raviel’s eyes. I hesitated. However, when Raviel looked at me like  this, wanting to do something with me, I couldn’t say no.  "}
{"text": "“T’ve never danced properly before.”  “There must be something of the butler’s memories remaining. Please refer to them.”  “What if I accidentally step on your foot? I’ ll kill myself.”  "}
{"text": "Instead of answering, Raviel moved. She bent down and took off her black shoes. A moment later, she  stepped barefoot onto the grass and dirt of the lawn.  "}
{"text": "White feet.  She only took off her shoes, but she seemed as light as the wind.  "}
{"text": "“Come here.”  I hesitantly took off my white shoes and socks. Raviel immediately took my hand and led me away.  One step. Two steps.  "}
{"text": "Raviel stepped on the petals that fell on the lawn on her tiptoes. The white petals of the magnolias and  cherry blossoms became whiter with every step.  "}
{"text": "Nobody made a sound. No music flowed. There wasn’t even a chandelier like the one that decorated  the ballroom, only moonlight that fell like frost in the flower garden.  A ball for just the two of us.  "}
{"text": "“...5ee?”  I smiled as I followed Raviel’s steps.  "}
{"text": "“1’m a mess. I already stepped on your foot three times. Dancing really isn’t my thing. Are you going to  kill me with shame?”  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s fine. I just need to step on your feet that many times.”  As soon as she said so, Raviel stepped on my foot. Her weight smoothly came onto mine. Raviel  laughed playfully.  "}
{"text": "“Look. We’re even.”  Here was a smile that she only showed to me in this world. My red jewel. My heart. My music.  The chandelier of the moon cast our shadows on the ground.  "}
{"text": "Our dance wasn’t about stepping on each other’s feet. It was about not letting go of our hands until the  end, even if we did step on the other’s foot. No matter what misfortune happened, we laughed a little  and looked at each other’s faces.  "}
{"text": "I belonged to Raviel alone.  Raviel was mine alone.  "}
{"text": "That was right. We danced. Every spot the moonlight reached was Raviel’s and my ballroom. So long  as there were two of us, any world could be our stage.  "}
{"text": "On this day, we became married.  Our next story would begin on a stage a little higher than the last.  [1]: Hui still means shining, but it has nicer connotations (bright, glorious).  "}

{"text": "“Shiny.”  [Shiny replies, Yes, warrior. ]  In Raviel’s and my bedroom, a sword rested on the large bed.  "}

{"text": "[The Prayer Sword says that she cannot serve a master other than Lefanta Aegim. ]  I opened my mouth.  “Do you know why Lefanta Aegim is killing Constellations?”  "}
{"text": "The red mist paused.  The mist did not have eyes, but I felt like we were facing off as I stared at the mist. There was a cool  tension between us.  "}
{"text": "“At first, I didn’t get it at all. I only understood after my experiences in this world. Those who are  called Constellations try to invade and take over other worlds and rule those places depending on their  personal preferences with no consideration to the natives’ opinions.”  "}
{"text": "His method was different, but it was the same for the [Corner Librarian].  The Librarian didn’t wish to rule the world but to observe the characters.  "}
{"text": "He designated the people who were living their lives as [characters]. He was a voyeur to their stories.  And, same as the other Constellations, the Librarian watched over the worlds to suit his taste.  "}
{"text": "In a word—  “Tt’s public harm.”  It was violence.  "}
{"text": "“Lefanta Aegim was once an emperor. He must have thought deeply. ‘Rather than coveting the  Constellations’ powers, I would rather kill them.’ I think that was his plan. This world probably had a  Constellation too, but Lefanta Aegim killed them.”  "}
{"text": "“But your original wielder made a mistake.”  I drew the tip of the sword.  “When a Constellation dies in a world, another is born. Look at it! On the continent where the  "}
{"text": "‘Guardian Goddess’ was sealed, the ‘Devil King of Fall Rain’ appeared. In this world, the ‘Silver-  Plated Heart’ arose. Frankly, your master isn’t solving problems. He’s causing bigger ones!”  [Lefanta Aegim is...]  "}
{"text": "“If I’m wrong, tell me no.”  The sword wrapped in the scarlet mist was silent.  “Maybe I don’t have as much experience as your master. Sure. Your master may have suffered a great  "}

{"text": "“If you’ve done something wrong, you need to take responsibility for it until the end.”  "}
{"text": "“There’s a world that was put into an eternal winter because your master deigned to kill a Constellation.  The people of that world were dishonored as they became moving corpses... Even if Lefanta Aegim  acted with noble intentions, that can’t be forgiven. Take responsibility.”  "}
{"text": "Then.  The red mist accumulated in one place. After a while, the mist took on a human shape.  A child whose whole body was stained with blood.  "}
{"text": "[My name is Prayer. ]  The sword in the form of a red child opened her mouth.  [My original role is to listen to people’s prayers. |  "}
{"text": "[Lefanta Aegim had made a wish. ‘I will kill all the Constellations so that nobody will ever be  manipulated by them again.’ His prayer is noble. It is significant. It is immense. So I entrusted my  existence to Lefanta Aegim. ]  "}
{"text": "[What prayer do you have, human? ]  I looked down at the child.  “To not run away from anything.”  "}
{"text": "Then, I continued, “I won’t turn away from what happens before me. I won’t make excuses. I’ll take  responsibility for what I say and do. I won’t look over things that are wrong and claim that’s just how  the world works. As long as I live and my sword can cut.”  "}

{"text": "“Mm. I guess you must.”  Raviel’s eyes met mine.  "}
{"text": "“T would like to follow you to visit another world, but the empire needs me. Just as I have my work,  you have your own. Do as you will, Gongja, and come back to me. If you feel tired and want to be  comforted, come back anytime. I’ll be here.”  "}

{"text": "“Uh, the 20th floor of the Tower is my land. I want to build a house for the two of us there. That is, if  you want it, Raviel.”  “Oho? Indeed. Will that become our family home in the future? In a new home, instead of being the  "}
{"text": "Duchess of Ivansia, I can just be your companion.”  Raviel smiled.  She read my mind like it was natural.  "}
{"text": "“T’1l look forward to it.”  Raviel took out a handkerchief from her bosom. A silver thread was embroidered over the white cloth.  She opened my hand and softly put the handkerchief in it.  "}
{"text": "This was...  "}
{"text": "“This is the handkerchief I usually carry with me. My perfume has been placed on it semi-permanently  using the power of magic.”  “Perfume?”  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s that one.”  Raviel stood on her tiptoes and whispered in my ear.  “The lily scent I used when you first fell for me.”  "}
{"text": "“Whenever you try to calm yourself, you touch the hilt of your dagger. It’s a horrid habit. Stop it.  Instead, whenever you’re upset, smell the scent on my handkerchief.”  "}
{"text": "Aaah.  “Gongja. Staying as you are shouldn’t be an unhappy thing. It isn’t painful. I wish it wasn’t. Your love  "}

{"text": "“Yeah. Something happened. It’s quite serious, too.”  Then again, something was weird here. Only top rankers were around, including the Black Dragon  "}

{"text": "“Think about it. In [The Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon], you showed off your humble and noble  side toward your master!

{"text": "The Crusader took over and said, “Someone spread the live broadcast in the Tower to the outside  world. Well, we actually allowed it to happen. Death King, your success is fantastic for advertising.  There was no reason to refuse.”  "}
{"text": "“But even so.” The Count held her fan. “We may have been just a tad bit too easygoing.”  “Too easygoing...?” I asked.  “Your character. No, the impact of your status as an [icon].”  "}

{"text": "“We’re a team. I can’t solve religious issues like the Heretic Questioner. I can’t deal with gang troubles  like the Venomous Snake, either. I can’t match you in politics, economics, or security. I’m not being  humble. It’s the truth.”  "}
{"text": "However.  “T never betray you. You can trust me.”  I was confident I could bring these talented people together.  "}
{"text": "“Tf there is a problem between you, I will mediate. If you need to talk, I’ll create a place for  conversation. Trust me. Let’s become one team.”  "}

{"text": "Chwaaaak!  My attack was very weak compared to the Devil King’s. Compared to Master’s, it was unbelievably  "}

{"text": "Of course she was dumbfounded. Thousands, maybe tens of thousands of apostles had literally  evaporated with a single blow. The plain had been infested with apostles mere moments ago, but the  places where the red aura scratched were barren.  "}

{"text": "Despite her surprise, the Black Dragon Master skillfully adjusted the positions of the mirrors. She  realized that my attack would destroy the enemies with just a touch, regardless of my output.  "}
{"text": "Therefore, it was important to spread the attack out as much as possible.  “Don’t mind me and keep attacking! Death King! I’ll take care of the mirrors!”  The mirrors flashed about in the air. The Black Dragon Master was someone who took immediate  "}

{"text": "I believed in the Black Dragon Master’s words and struck again. I was just using a familiar art to me,  but tens of thousands of enemy troops were wiped out. Ranks two and three. The Black Dragon Master  and my combo attack one-sidedly ravaged the Constellation’s forces.  "}

{"text": "as hunger. They didn’t need to dig up resources from the ground to continue living. The apostles sang  happily anytime, anywhere, in the form of children.  -Kyaaaah!  "}
{"text": "However.  In the heart of this world was an innocent child, stabbed by a sword.  -Aaaagh! Euh, aah! Aaaack!  "}
{"text": "How the innocent child’s scream became power, I didn’t know. The sword in the child’s chest was  probably forging the rules of this world.  "}
{"text": "-The world I’ve constructed is far more stable than your worthless dump!  The Constellation shouted over the child’s screams.  "}
{"text": "-Don'’t you dare show your hypocrisy to me, invaders! I followed Lefanta Aegim to countless worlds.  The screams never stopped in any of them. Hundreds of thousands! Millions! Tens of millions!  Hundreds of millions!  "}
{"text": "The sword named ‘Sacrifice’ lamented.  -Meanwhile, only one in my world. Only one! With one scapegoat, my apostles live a life without  knowing pain. I have committed one sin, but you turn away from hundreds of millions of sins. What  "}
{"text": "justification do you trash have to destroy my world?!!  I understood.  "}
{"text": "The Constellation must have set this up after repeated thoughts and agonizing. And, she must have  done so with good intentions.  "}
{"text": "If the road to hell is paved with good intentions, this was the hell that [The Evangelist of Everlasting  Happiness] chose.  ‘This world is just an extreme example.’  "}
{"text": "The challenges that I, that we face while running the Tower would be no different. When food is scarce.  When resources run out. As the people responsible for the Tower, we will have to sacrifice someone.  "}
{"text": "-Ha!  The Constellation laughed at my silence.  "}
{"text": "-You still have enough of a conscience not to say your drivel. If you can’t answer, leave! I will never  recognize you as a new master!  “No. I have a response.”  "}
{"text": "I took a step forward.  -A response? Ha. What kind of response can someone like you give?  "}
{"text": "It would be easy to recite the argument that sacrifice is still wrong.  However, an argument was not meant to be said. It must be lived through with one’s body. Only when  "}
{"text": "one can take responsibility for what one says, when one can actualize the argument, is it valid.  I did not forget this point.  "}
{"text": "“T will kill you all.”  -What?  “T will kill you all and make you into ghosts.”  "}
{"text": "The Constellation did not seem to understand me.  -What are you talking about now...  “All who die by my sword are collected as ghosts. If I want, I can summon them with all the memories  "}
{"text": "they had in life. I’ be killing all of you, then summoning you to live in this world again.”  I raised the Holy Sword.  "}
{"text": "“You want to live happily ever after. I’ll let you. A life in which you don’t suffer, don’t remember  suffering, and just sing like you do now. I’ll make it real.”  "}
{"text": "“The ghosts don’t even need to eat to live. I will give you the world that you want.”  It was simple.  I would kill millions of apostles.  "}
{"text": "After killing them, I could summon them back to this world.  I would bring back their memories from when they were alive.  Nothing would change.  "}
{"text": "“T’m not talking to you alone.”  The inhabitants of the Tower who were watching our party at this moment.  "}
{"text": "To the innumerable people watching, I made a proclamation.  “There are evil people who cannot be reformed. There are sinners who cannot change their minds.  There are some souls who want to live again but cannot. From now on, I will execute them with my  "}

{"text": "“T see! No, why didn’t we think of this until now? It’s a really good idea, Death King!”  The Black Dragon Master wrinkled her brows.  “What are you talking about?”  "}
{"text": "“Think about it. Death King’s skill doesn’t just summon someone. It can give them their memories  from life! Therefore, we can use Death King as a [moving prison]!”  The sound of the Heretic Questioner’s distinctive laughter echoed throughout the silent plain.  "}

{"text": "“That’s right. As the master of the Ten Thousand Temple, I also agree!”  The Heretic Questioner grinned. An impromptu meeting of the greatest guilds’ leaders was being held.  “The purpose of a prison is to [contain criminals] and [prevent further offenses]. However, no matter  "}
{"text": "how excellent a corrections program is, it’s hard to stop all recidivism. A human mind is as complex as  it is beautiful. But the four kings can completely prevent recidivism!”  The Crusader hesitated.  "}

{"text": "black eyes.  “Will you really be all right?”  "}
{"text": "I felt that she felt sorry. The Black Dragon Master was feeling some sense of responsibility. The  responsibility for bringing me into their world.  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s all right,” I said with conviction.  I was grateful. She was taking responsibility even though I jumped into this world of my own volition.  The Black Dragon Master was a kind and honorable person. Someday, I would hear her real name.  "}

{"text": "-Uh...  Bae Hu-ryeong uncharacteristically hesitated. His eyebrows furrowed, and his face seemed to reflect  that he was considering what to say.  "}
{"text": "-You get a very... peculiar appearance and state of mind...  “Kieeeeek!”  "}
{"text": "-Oh, lucky. There’s one now.  I turned around.  "}
{"text": "A toad-like monster was curled up.  “Kioeeek!”  However, the problem was that I didn’t know any toads with approximately 36 legs or shark teeth.  "}
{"text": "Also, the monster looked to weigh about two tons.  “What the heck is that?!”  "}
{"text": "-Who knows? He was probably a person much like you. A human who ate, shat, and talked shit like you  do. Well, maybe 20 years ago.  While Bae Huo-ryeong was leisurely speaking, boing! A two-ton monster toad leaped forward.  "}
{"text": "Anybody could tell that it was rushing toward me. I was taken aback, but I focused my aura on my feet  and jumped far away.  Ba-ba-bang!  "}
{"text": "The ground shook. The boom was a little too brisk to say that it was the toad’s fault. The ground had  caved in, forming what looked like a small crater.  "}
{"text": "“Ah, fuck.”  I pulled out the Holy Sword and used the Infernal Heavens Demonic Art. Chwak! The blade wrapped  "}
{"text": "in red aura sliced through the monster toad’s waist.  Did I kill it?  -Ah.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong said suddenly.  "}
{"text": "-Sorry, Kim Zombie. I didn’t warn you earlier, but... From the 50th floor, it’s literally a world of  demons. There will be a lot of times you’ll get screwed if you act according to your old common sense.  “What are you trying to say?”  "}
{"text": "That moment, something sprang out from the sliced cross-sections of the monster toad. It was a leg that  looked like a tentacle. Instantly, dozens of tentacles fell out, bringing the toad back to its feet.  "}
{"text": "“Kieeeek!”  “Kiyoook!”  "}
{"text": "This time, there was not one but two.  -Yeah. Stuff like that.  “What the hell?”  "}
{"text": "-If you’re scared, keep staring at the Magic Towers. If you stare for more than 23 seconds, they’Il talk  to you. ‘Who the fuck’s looking at us?’ and such. Then, if you ask them to save you, wizards on brooms  will come to the rescue. What do you think? Aren’t they nice?  "}
{"text": "I wasn’t just imagining it; Bae Hu-ryeong had been grinning for a while. And if Bae Hu-ryeong was  grinning, there was a very high probability that he was messing with me.  "}
{"text": "In other words.  “_,.What’s the cost of being saved?”  -Heh, you’ve got some brains. How did you know? They’Il make you sign a soul-draining contract that  "}
{"text": "takes 12 years of your life as collateral. Zombie, you have SSS-class skills, so you’ll get a lot of love  from them. How envious!  Frick...  "}
{"text": "“Y-you over there! Hurry and run away!”  I heard a voice calling urgently behind my back.  “This way! Run over here! Quickly!”  "}
{"text": "When I turned around, three old men in shabby cloaks were beckoning. Their clothes were caked with  filth like they were homeless, but their eyes revealed profound wisdom. The voice was also so  desperate that I almost went to them without thinking.  "}
{"text": "-Heh.  "}
{"text": "However, I couldn’t do that because of Bae Hu-ryeong’s mug staring at me, which made my mind  pause. My feet stopped on instinct.  Instead of running to the old men, I sent my aura at them.  "}
{"text": "“This way!”  “Run this way!”  "}
{"text": "“Quickly!”  As soon as my attack approached them, something terrifying happened. Jump! Something surged from  "}
{"text": "the ground where the old men were standing.  It was a hedgehog-like... ‘something.’  "}
{"text": "“Y-you over there!  Hurry and run away!”  “This way!”  "}
{"text": "But instead of spines on its back, there were three old men.  “This is insane...”  "}
{"text": "In short, they weren’t actually old men at all. The monster’s back was just a lure to draw people in and  eat them.  -Hey, hey. As expected of Kim Zombie. You’re naive, but you know how to use your head. What kind of  "}
{"text": "place is this? Thinking rationally, would there be old people helping you for no reason? Hmm?  “Kieeeeek!”  “Run this way!”  "}
{"text": "“Kiyooook!”  “Quickly!”  A monster toad and a monster hedgehog ran at me simultaneously. Dozens of tentacles wriggled on the  "}
{"text": "toad’s skin, and three old men sang a chorus on the hedgehog’s back.  This sight was totally going to sully my mind.  “Is everything like this here?!”  "}
{"text": "-There are a few ‘exceptions,’ but it’s mostly like this. Welcome to the Demon World, where cosmic  horrors dance, crow-tit. Now do you see how normal and sensible a Hunter I am?  "}
{"text": "“This isn’t the time...!”  I wasn’t sure if it was fortunate or not, but—  "}
{"text": "“—Duck your head, stranger.”  The [exception] that Bae Hu-ryeong mentioned suddenly appeared.  “T will cut.”  "}
{"text": "A voice that used aura to directly enter your head. It was the telepathy skill, Sound Transmission. I  quickly ducked my head as the voice decreed. At that moment, the sound of wind being cut and a  horrifying attack passed over my head.  "}
{"text": "Chwaaaak!  Two monster toads were bisected at once.  "}
{"text": "Remembering the sight of the toad’s regeneration, I panickedly yelled.  “No, if you cut it, it splits and regenerates...!”  I stopped talking. The monster toads did not move and stayed cut.  "}
{"text": "In other words, they were dead.  ‘What? Does it only regenerate once before it dies normally?’  -Mm, no~ It regenerates many times~  "}
{"text": "‘Then, why did they die?’  -That happened because...  Someone else explained it before Bae Hu-ryeong could.  "}
{"text": "“To kill [one that dies in half],”  The Sound Transmission user was speaking.  "}
{"text": "“As its name suggests, it must be split to exact [halves].”  Bewildered, I glanced at the corpses.  As he said, the monster toads were split in exact halves down the center of their bodies. Somehow, that  "}
{"text": "caused them to die permanently.  “Next.”  "}
{"text": "The Sound Transmission user immediately pointed his sword at the monster hedgehog.  He swung.  Kwaang...!  "}
{"text": "Explosions sounded each time.  Despite the fearsome aura, the monster hedgehog took the hits like they were insignificant.  ‘It’s like the Lady of the Golden Silk when she had the blessing...’  "}
{"text": "The monster hedgehog rushed forth like it was taking no damage, but the Sound Transmission user  continued to strike blow after blow.  "}
{"text": "“This way,”  Boom...!  "}
{"text": "The cries of the old man on the left were buried by the explosive slash.  “Run,”  Boom...!  "}
{"text": "The cries of the old man on the right were buried by an explosive slash.  “Come here,”  "}
{"text": "Boom...!  The cries of the old man in the center were buried in the blast of the cut.  “A lamenter’s noumenon is in its lament.”  "}
{"text": "The moment the sound of the old men’s cries were buried in the explosions, the hedgehog fell apart like  sand.  "}
{"text": "“So you must kill it by burying its sound.”  Two types of monsters were neutralized in the blink of an eye.  Extensive knowledge of the prey and the overwhelming power to utilize that knowledge.  ‘A Hunter...’  "}
{"text": "I blankly looked at the Hunter, the Sound Transmission user.  Bae Hu-ryeong grumbled.  -Man, that bastard. He’s not even that old.  "}
{"text": "The silver-haired youth I saw in Shiny’s trauma.  “Lefanta Aegim...”  "}
{"text": "The Constellation Killer.  Lefanta Aegim tilted his head as he put away his sword.  “Do you know me?”  "}

{"text": "Chapter 126. < The Demon World. (2) >  Translator: thursdays Editor: Yahiko PR: LightBrin  I was speechless for a moment when I saw Lefanta Aegim’s eyes.  "}
{"text": "“Why does he have eyes like that?’  I’ve met all sorts of people so far. I met someone who swung a sword bleaker than a snowfield. I met  someone who had a heart colder than a white lily. However, it was the first time I met someone with  "}

{"text": "No emotions—no memories at all were reflected in his pupils. There were no fragments or even traces  of emotion.  "}

{"text": "[However, Shiny still doesn’t understand why her former owner betrayed her. She wonders if she  should be angry before getting excited! ]  “_,. You have quite a unique sword.”  "}
{"text": "Lefanta Aegim looked down at my sword belt. The Holy Sword rattled, fiercely conveying her  thoughts. Lefanta Aegim’s impassive gaze had a hint of curiosity within it.  "}
{"text": "“Ts it a magic sword? Or perhaps an ego sword... You should hide the fact you have unique items as  much as you can here, stranger. There are many hyenas who seek to take the skills and equipment of  newbies who enter the 50th floor.”  "}
{"text": "‘Huh?’  I was suspicious.  "}
{"text": "It was weird. Lefanta Aegim was talking like it was the first time he had seen [The Guardian Goddess].  If the young man in front of me really was the Constellation Killer, there was no way he wouldn’t  remember who this Holy Sword was.  "}
{"text": "“Excuse me. Do you not recognize this sword?”  y  I took off the Holy Sword from my belt and showed it to Lefanta Aegim. When I pulled it out from its  "}
{"text": "scabbard a little, a bright light glowed from the blade.  “Mim ”  "}
{"text": "Nonetheless.  Lefanta Aegim faced the light of the Holy Sword, the manifestation of the Constellation that was once  "}
{"text": "like his arms and legs, and... frowned, like he knew nothing.  “T don’t know it.”  His statue-like face tilted to the side.  "}
{"text": "“Tt seems like the item has some sort of relation to me. But I don’t remember... No, it would be  insensible for it to expect me to recall any connections I once had.”  "}
{"text": "“What?”  Then, Lefanta Aegim told me something I did not expect.  "}
{"text": "“T have amnesia. Stranger, I cannot remember anything that happened more than a week ago.”  The man’s expression was composed.  3:  "}
{"text": "“Tt’s dangerous to keep talking in this wasteland. Follow me. I know an alehouse that’s comparatively  safer.”  "}
{"text": "Saying that, Lefanta Aegim guided me there. Since it was my first time on the 50th floor, I obediently  followed his lead.  “Oi...”  "}
{"text": "“Look there. It’s the Constellation Killer.”  We passed some Hunters on the way to the alehouse. They were probably the greatest Hunters of their  worlds. But even they took a step back and shuddered when they saw the Constellation Killer.  "}
{"text": "“What kind of shit is that maniac going to do now...?”  “Will the spiders from the Magic Towers behave today?”  "}
{"text": "“Shh. I don’t want to get involved with him...”  It wasn’t just Hunters who were whispering.  "}
{"text": "[‘The Lone Seeker of Truth’ is interested in this existence they have never seen before. ]  [‘The Eye Living in the Labyrinth’ shows wariness toward the Constellation Killer’s companion. ]  [‘The Warhorse of the Eternal Plains’ recognizes you. ]  "}
{"text": "[‘The Lotus Reflected on the Water’ observes you. ]  Numerous Constellations.  "}
{"text": "I hadn’t met many Constellations so far. No Constellation contacted me unless they were the ruler of a  floor. But it seemed to be different on the 50th floor. Constellations I had never heard of revealed their  presences.  "}
{"text": "“.,. Annoying.”  Lefanta Aegim also seemed to sense the Constellations’ messages.  "}
{"text": "He muttered, “Get lost, all of you. If a Constellation stays and keeps bothering me, I’ll hunt and kill  your apostle starting today. You can keep loafing if you want war. This is your last warning.”  "}
{"text": "As Lefanta Aegim finished talking, the messages from the Constellations abruptly stopped. The  constricting air around us became a bit lighter.  “Tt’s noisier than usual. Haa...”  "}
{"text": "Lefanta Aegim briefly sighed and looked at me.  “Some of them seem interested in you. Stranger, did you do something to the Constellations?”  “Yeah. I killed an apostle of [The Warhorse of the Eternal Plains] before.”  "}
{"text": "“,..Mahos’s apostle?”  Lefanta Aegim’s tone changed. He took out an old notebook, read something, then crooked his  "}
{"text": "eyebrows in apparent surprise.  “You’re better than you look. All of the apostles of Mahos are, without exception, outstanding in battle.  They also have troublesome blessings. He must have been a difficult opponent... How did you kill  "}
{"text": "him?”  “T have something to say about that.”  We entered the alehouse.  "}
{"text": "The ‘comparatively safer’ alehouse Lefanta Aegim spoke of was an outdoor establishment. Frankly put,  there were no walls. There were just some tables and a bar placed outside. It was open on all sides, but  funnily enough, a door stood by itself.  "}
{"text": "“ .. This is the safe alehouse?”  “Your vision isn’t blocked by walls.”  Lefanta Aegim candidly explained the merits of the tavern.  "}
{"text": "“Whenever you are ambushed, you can run. There is no risk of being surrounded and trapped inside the  building. It does make it easier to be shot, though. Bartender, give me my usual.”  "}
{"text": "“Oi. You know that the place became open-air after you blew the building away...?”  The bald bartender cursed under his breath. Lefanta Aegim sat at a table, blasé.  “Sorry. I don’t recall.”  "}
{"text": "“Hey, youngster. I don’t know what’s up, but don’t get involved with that madman. Over 600 huntsmen  around here are trying to kill him. Keep your distance unless you have a death wish.”  "}
{"text": "Lefanta Aegim took out his notebook again.  “To be precise, there are 1127. However, only three Hunters can actually threaten me. One of them  disappeared 154 years ago, and there’s been no word since. Technically, the stranger is safer with me  "}
{"text": "than without.”  “You nutcase...”  "}
{"text": "The bald bartender looked fed up.  In any case, it seemed that the Constellation Killer was famous on the 50th floor for being a nutjob.  “So, what did you want to say to me?”  "}
{"text": "“_,. Knowing you have amnesia, it’s a bit difficult to say now.”  I slowly told him about what had happened.  "}
{"text": "The Aegim Empire that he founded nearly perished.

{"text": "Sormwyn Academy] had also been put at risk...  I told him everything.  "}
{"text": "Lefanta Aegim carefully listened to my voice while drinking a mysterious red drink. His expression  remained the same the whole time. Occasionally, he would take out his notebook and check something.  "}
{"text": "ee baa =| <n  Lefanta Aegim nodded.  “T hear your story. And verifying it against my diary, I think most of it is true.”  "}
{"text": "“A diary?”  “Tt stores my memories.”  Lefanta Aegim showed me his notebook.  "}
{"text": "Inside was a lot of cramped handwriting.  “Tt may look like a normal notebook, but it’s a holy relic of a Constellation called [The Great Puppy]. It  "}
{"text": "has infinite pages and a convenient search function. I write down what I do every day. Thanks to that, I  do not lose my life despite my amnesia.”  “As you said,” he bluntly stated, “it’s been written that I built a nation called the Aegim Empire in the  "}
{"text": "past.”  He spoke like it was someone else’s story.  "}
{"text": "“There, I sealed the Constellation [Guardian Goddess], who had accompanied me my whole life. [The  Chronicles of the Heavenly Demon] you referenced is similar to the world recorded on page 236. [The  Yellow Dragon of Dynasty Lake] was killed there.

{"text": "“The heirloom that was a fragment of a goddess... You said the Sacrifice Sword was passed down?  True, I did sleep with a woman in that world.

{"text": "curious.”  Something...  “You may have learned of my past with a skill like [Exposing the Dark Past] or [Historian].”  "}
{"text": "Something was off.  “But I don’t have a past to read. There is no possibility that you’ve stolen and read this relic. It’s  written in a code that only I know. Therefore, stranger, I will accept your testimonies as the truth.”  "}
{"text": "I came to hold this man accountable for his sins.  "}
{"text": "His petty principles caused innocent people to be hurt. I would boldly point to the countless people he  had sacrificed.  But what was this?  "}
{"text": "“So.”  How can I hold him accountable for something he doesn’t even remember?  “What kind of reward do you want?”  "}
{"text": "Anger soared in my heart.  “What reward?”  "}
{"text": "“A reward for pointing out my mistakes.”  “_,.Are you aware of what you did wrong?”  "}
{"text": "“Of course,” said the Constellation Killer. “My mistakes come down to two things. First, I did not think  of the possibility that new Constellations would be born if a Constellation disappeared in a world.  Second, I neglected the fact that a dead Constellation could place a curse on the world.”  "}
{"text": "Taste  “Ts that all?”  “T did not intend for other Constellations to invade a world after the death of a Constellation. But no  "}
{"text": "matter how many worlds a Constellation rules over, it all ends when I kill it. Reducing the number of  Constellations is not a mistake. Therefore, my errors include only the two mentioned earlier.”  After he finished talking, the Constellation Killer took out a pen and wrote something in his notebook.  "}
{"text": "“T recorded them. I will not make the same mistakes in the future. Tell me what you want as an  expression of my gratitude for this advice.”  "}
{"text": "Advice.  Gratitude, he said.  "}
{"text": "“The common folk who lived in the land of rivers and lakes turned into Jiangshi and died.”  Twitch.  The Holy Sword, which had been listening to my conversation in its scabbard, trembled once.  The fury from my heart was echoed in my voice.  "}
{"text": "“One of them was an old man who, even as he was dying, made his grave on a boat because he didn’t  want to trouble others. There was a young child who took care of her peers as they all struggled to  survive.”  "}
{"text": "“Each and every one of them met a terrible death. Let me ask you, Constellation Killer. What do you  think of them?”  "}
{"text": "“Nothing,” said Lefanta Aegim. “As I said, it was my blunder for not taking care of the aftermath of the  Constellation’s death. But mistakes happen. As I said, the only thing I can do is give a reward for  pointing out those mistakes.”  "}
{"text": "“Ha.”  The red aura around my body became a little darker.  "}
{"text": "“Then, if I asked you to die here as my reward, would you?”  “That’s a reward I cannot give you.”  The silver-haired man shook his head.  "}
{"text": "“T have a duty to exterminate all Constellations. I mustn’t stop until I fulfill that duty.”  He sounded more like machine than man. Shiny’s form shuddered.  16  "}
{"text": "“That’s quite the tremendous task. Why is it that you shoulder such an obligation?”  “TI cannot give you an answer.”  “T expected as much. Why? Do you think I won’t understand that noble duty?”  "}
{"text": "“T cannot answer that, either.”  “Oh, of course.”  "}
{"text": "I stared coldly at the Constellation Killer.  "}
{"text": "“Then, can you at least answer this? Why are you using a Constellation’s relic when you claim you  have to destroy all Constellations? Your words don’t match your actions.”  “That’s something I can answer. I intend to destroy it after all Constellations are exterminated.”  "}
{"text": "“You learned from the case of the Devil King of Fall Rain that a Constellation can rise in a world  where the previous Constellation died. What will you do about that?”  "}
{"text": "“T have an idea for that.”  “What is it?”  "}
{"text": "“T cannot say.”  The Constellation Killer looked inside his diary.  “This tangent has gone on for too long. Let’s go back to the main topic.”  "}
{"text": "“This is the main topic for me.”  “Not for me. Tell me what you want as the reward.”  Reward.  "}
{"text": "“T cannot die as you asked me to before. Because my duty is not finished, I cannot give you my death  as a reward.”  "}
{"text": "He was probably reading the words on the first page of his diary.  “Nor can I quit. If I relinquish my duty, I will be nothing.”  The first page he wrote before he lost all of his memories.  "}
{"text": "“So tell me what else you want. I’ll give it to you.”  That was right.  "}
{"text": "Not many things in the world could be resolved with a conversation.  I reached for my dagger, but I stopped my hand mid-way. Instead, I took out the handkerchief that I  kept near my heart. I briefly buried my nose into the handkerchief that carried Raviel’s blue scent.  "}
{"text": "Hm.  “ .. All right.”  My anger subsided.  "}
{"text": "I thought quickly. How could I hunt the Hunter in front of me, a Hunter whose strength I couldn’t  fathom?  "}
{"text": "My brain soon came up with an answer.  “Then, please listen to a single request.”  "}
{"text": "It was simple.  This wasn’t the first time I hunted a Hunter stronger than me.  "}
{"text": "“What is it?”  “While I am on the 50th floor, please keep me safe no matter what happens.”  I tucked away the handkerchief.  "}
{"text": "“I’m not just asking for you to protect my life. Please thoroughly protect my body and mind from harm.  Of course, tricking or forcing me out the 50th floor is forbidden.”  "}
{"text": "“_,.. You’re requesting me to personally guard you?”  “Something like that.”  The Constellation Killer thought over it.  "}
{"text": "He grabbed a fountain pen and rhythmically tapped it on the table.  “T do not know what you’ re thinking. From hearing your story so far, I can tell that you are a very  "}
{"text": "righteous person. Not only that, but you also have power and ingenuity. The offer just now does not  agree with your personality.”  “Aha. Are you saying you can’t grant my request?”  "}
{"text": "I sneered.  “You can’t die. You can’t abandon your duty. And now, you can’t even protect me on the 50th floor?  You’re quite something. Then, what kind of reward can you give me?”  "}
{"text": "“’..’m merely concerned about the traps that lurk in your request.”  “Tf there is a trap, so what? You seem confident in your ability. Overcome it with your skills.”  "}
{"text": "Lefanta Aegim intently stared at his diary.  “All right.”  He moved his fountain pen. Scritch, scratch. His writing seeped into the diary.  "}
{"text": "“T will write your proposal on the first page. Until the end of my existence, your proposal will be the  logic that drives my thoughts and actions.”  "}
{"text": "Okay.  I caught him.  ‘Sword Emperor.’  "}
{"text": "I looked back at Bae Hu-ryeong.  -Yeah?  "}
{"text": "“You said that you knocked down a Magic Tower 150 years ago.’  The backdrop that stood out as soon as I fell in this place.  "}

{"text": "“In the future, I will keep strong outside intervention in mind even when dealing with novices.”  “Frick! Run for it!”  “Are the spider bastards all on drugs?!”  "}
{"text": "The Hunters around us reacted faster than the Constellation Killer. Pop! Poof! Everywhere,  teleportation scrolls were being torn. It must have been a necessity for the Hunters living on the 50th  floor. The bald bartender did so too, but just before he ran away, he screamed at us.  "}
{"text": "“Hey! Constellation Killer! You’ll be responsible for the remodeling fee again, so don’t forget to write  it down! You have to pay for the scroll, too!”  "}
{"text": "“All right.”  Snap.  "}
{"text": "“T’ve completed the entry.”  The Constellation Killer closed his notebook.  “As promised, I will protect you with all my might from now, stranger.”  "}
{"text": "Finally, the meteor shower was thundering down on our surroundings. Boom! Boom! The meteorites  destroyed the streets like indiscriminate bombs. As the storm of destruction was about to hit the open-  air tavern, a hand gripped my wrist tightly.  "}
{"text": "“Maximum vision and hearing. In exchange, I give up [1 hour] of my memories,” the Constellation  Killer muttered.  "}
{"text": "Then, he moved in a shocking stunt.  The Constellation Killer avoided the barrage of meteors that filled the sky with only slight movements.  "}
{"text": "One step. Two steps. Every time he pulled me and moved, a meteor struck down close by.  -Oh?  An indignant voice echoed from the sky.  "}
{"text": "-Hey, Constellation-crazy bastard! Why are you getting in the way? Fuck off! Our Magic Tower’s got a  grudge against the guy you’re with! If you don’t want grievances with the great wand, be good and  disappear!  "}
{"text": "“First, let’s try to resolve this through conversation.”  "}
{"text": "The Constellation Killer waved his right hand. As he did, the dust cloud from the meteor shower was  cleared away at once. The Constellation Killer himself was fine, of course, and so was I.  -Conversation, my ass! Beat it, nutso!  "}
{"text": "“T must protect this stranger here no matter what happens. Protecting means ensuring that his body and  mind remain whole. There is no room for compromise.”  "}
{"text": "The Constellation Killer took out his notebook with his left hand and read it.  “The Magic Tower is an extremely egoistic group. Being egoists, they can be negotiated with by either  "}
{"text": "using their interests or harming them. I am one who can cause serious damage to you. So, negotiate.”  -That’s our sworn enemy and foe! We. Cannot. Live. Under. The. Same. Sky!  "}
{"text": "“All problems can be solved through rational dialogue.”  -Hey! Hey! Guys! Let me know if any of you know how much memory the Constellation Killer has?  In the sky, tens of thousands of wizards were riding on brooms. One of them replied.  "}
{"text": "-This is the public relations chair of the constant surveillance group, reporting in! Chief! The  Constellation Killer currently has seven days of memories!  "}
{"text": "-Fuck, why does he have to have a full week?  There was the sound of teeth grinding.  -It doesn’t matter! Take them both out, including the Constellation maniac! As of now, the Magic Tower  "}
{"text": "is entering a full mobilization situation! From the first finger to the fifth, all who belong to the Magic  Tower must hunt the Sword Emperor and the Constellation Killer! I’ll say it again, bastards! I’m  calling for a full mobilization!  "}
{"text": "“_,. The negotiations have fallen through,” muttered the Constellation Killer.  He flipped through the diary he held in his left hand.  “Search, Magic Tower. Additional search, battle. Detailed search, destruction method.”  "}
{"text": "The Constellation Killer scanned the diary. Then, he nodded. He took out a rubber band—a yellow  rubber band that could be bought inexpensively in the outside world—and tied back his long, silver  hair.  "}
{"text": "I watched the Constellation Killer slowly tie his hair right beside me. It probably only took two seconds  in terms of time. However, I could tell that the action was a ritual, one of the few that he had left.  "}
{"text": "“From now on, we fight.”  -Kill them!!  "}
{"text": "Tens of thousands of wizards swarmed down from the sky.  -Ensigns, surround them!  Not all enemy troops charged forth.  "}
{"text": "-Songsters, chant from the rear!  -Yes!  "}
{"text": "The wizards got into battle formation in the gray sky. Their formation looked like a huge ring.  Hundreds of wizards formed five rings and began to sing in unison.  A melody with six layers resounded.  "}
{"text": "-Oh.  Bae Hu-ryeong said.  "}
{"text": "-I haven’ seen this in a while. That’s the Others’ Heavenly Song.  ‘Others’ Heavenly Song?’  -There are five spires over there. Each has a Constellation sealed in the basement. Well, I say sealed,  "}
{"text": "but they’re really imprisoned. Anyway, the sealed Constellations’ power is borrowed through the song,  and the effect...  [Warning. The area you are in has been designated as the target of a spell. ]  "}

{"text": "[Warning. Any penalty you incur will be doubled. ]  Bae Hu-ryeong nodded.  "}
{"text": "-Mm. The effect is pretty damn strong.  ‘The heck?’  "}
{"text": "-That’s called the spider web. That’s why they’re nicknamed “spiders.”  Indeed, they were a monstrous group who had ruled the 50th floor for over a thousand years. They  drastically reduced their opponents’ fighting power before the battle even began. And Bae Hu-ryeong,  "}
{"text": "who had torn up this spider web 150 years ago... must have been a monster among monsters.  “—One strike. Strengthening.”  "}
{"text": "One human who could fight against that monster was in front of my eyes.  “In exchange, I give up my memories of the beauty of the sunset.”  At some point, the Constellation Killer had summoned a sword into his right hand.  "}
{"text": "First step.  The Constellation Killer lightly swung his sword like he was dancing.  The air split.  "}
{"text": "His move was more like a typhoon than the swing of a sword. A blue aura sliced the gray sky into two.  One of the six rings in the sky was caught by the typhoon.  "}
{"text": "-R-regroup! Regroup!  -Retreat!  "}
{"text": "Hundreds of wizards screamed and fell. There were also wizards who lost control of their brooms and  plunged to the ground. The wizards’ pointy hats fluttered like black flower petals.  [The increased penalty effect has been revoked. ]  "}
{"text": "However, the Constellation Killer did not stop.  A curt voice flowed from his lips.  “Strengthening one blow. In return, I give up my memories of the sound of the rain falling from the  "}
{"text": "sky.”  Once again, the sky was split asunder.  "}
{"text": "[The power of your halved aura has been recovered! |  -That madman! Nutjob! Constellation maniac!  -Break the thumb ring! Break the index finger ring! It’s hard to keep rank!  "}
{"text": "-Ch-chief! As expected, it’s too difficult to fight the Constellation Killer when he has a full week’s  memories!  "}
{"text": "-That damned Constellation-maniac bastard! All right, so shut up and attack! Charge!  The wizards shot fireballs. They spat out ice. The ground on which the Constellation Killer and I stood  "}
{"text": "sprouted tree roots and weeds instantaneously, grabbing hold of our ankles. The air was crawling. The  jungle grew denser. Fog spread and hindered our vision. An unfathomable number of magic and  wonders covered the two of us.  "}
{"text": "And.  “Strengthening one blow.”  "}
{"text": "The Constellation Killer merely held a diary in one hand and his sword in the other.  “In exchange, I give up my memories of children’s smiles.”  All of the magic and wonders were torn down.  "}
{"text": "[The power of your halved magic has been restored! ]  [The power of your halved mental defense has been restored! |  "}
{"text": "[The area-of-effect designation has been canceled. ]  The fireballs were snuffed out. The ice blocks shattered. The tree roots were sliced through, the weeds  rotted. A blue wind blew through the air, and the jungle disappeared. After the fog cleared, the wizards  "}
{"text": "groaned.  -Break the middle finger ring! Break the ring finger ring! The pinky finger ring, too!  -All the songs have been destroyed, Chief!  "}
{"text": "-That guy’s perfectly attacking the weaknesses of each ring?!  -Fuck...! Which bitch sold all our secrets...?!  "}
{"text": "I stared blankly at the battle taking place right before my eyes.  The magicians attacked relentlessly. However, there was no use. The Constellation Killer fought by  discarding his memories of the drink he just had, the streets he walked on yesterday, and other trivial  "}
{"text": "memories.  A single Hunter stood against tens of thousands of wizards.  -What do you think? Isn’t his battle strategy the complete opposite of yours ?  "}

{"text": "Constellation Killer is the reverse. He discards his memories.  His demonic art was the direct opposite of mine.  -Take a good look. You’Il have to fight on this level one day.  "}
{"text": "The Constellation Killer’s fighting style was composed but gruesome.  “T give up my memory of taking a walk under the gentle sky.”  "}
{"text": "One by one, he discarded his memories. The Constellation Killer’s tone was light, and his sword was  simple. His fighting was calm, in that sense.  "}
{"text": "“I give up my memory of people’s screams when they are in pain.”  However, not a single memory he cast away was insignificant. The longer the fight continued, the more  memories opened like boxes, one after the other. They were Pandora’s Boxes. A box with contents that  "}
{"text": "evaporated after being opened.  -The Constellation Killer lives with a day to a week’s worth of memories.  Bae Hu-ryeong said.  "}
{"text": "-He rarely has memories for more than a week. It’s because that guy leaves to hunt a Constellation  after a week. A week’s memories are enough for him to hunt a Constellation.  "}
{"text": "-Did he say he had amnesia? Technically, that’s wrong. That guy is fulfilling his duty at the expanse of  his memories.  "}
{"text": "That was...  To be more precise, he was burning his own life.  [Shiny cannot watch her previous owner’s fight. ]  My holy sword trembled.  "}
{"text": "[Shiny remembers that her former master did not fight that way in the past. She does not know when or  why he became like this. ]  "}
{"text": "Before I knew it, the Magic Tower’s army was utterly exhausted.  All of the circular rings had long been destroyed.  "}
{"text": "At first, they formed strict ranks, attacking and retreating from the Constellation Killer... but they  seemed to have reached their limit. Their formation crumbled. Wizards attacked sporadically.  -Ch-chief. See, we can’t fight the Constellation Killer with one week’s worth of memories...  "}
{"text": "-We said that he was a shitty strong character...  -If you force more magic here, the damage will not be little!  -The surveillance team has been making noise since earlier. Chief. The Constellations have noticed the  "}
{"text": "anomalies and are watching closely. There is a high probability that they’ll attack us when we are  weakened.  -Euk!  "}
{"text": "The one who seemed to be the wizards’ chief ground her teeth. She took off her pointy hat and  crumpled it in her left hand. With immense anger in her eyes, the wizard stared at me.  "}
{"text": "-Sword Emperor... Sword Emperor, Sword Emperor, Sword Emperor!!  -Ah, man. My popularity hasn’t faded even after death.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong shrugged his shoulders.  -Look, Zombie. This is why it’s a problem when someone’s just too awesome.  -I know well that you have made an alliance with the Constellation Killer! Expect our return! Our  "}
{"text": "Magic Tower will do whatever it takes to hunt you down! This time, we end with a simple battle of  power, but next time, for sure...!  The wizards looked aghast.  "}
{"text": "-Woah... Chief, that’s typically the line a loser says while fleeing...  -Shh. Don’t bother the chief now. You’|l be turned into a frog and eaten.  "}
{"text": "-I’Il definitely kick your ass!!  When the wizards scattered and their ensigns retreated, the Constellation Killer opened his mouth.  “Wait. Magic Tower Master.”  "}
{"text": "-What?!  “T still have 23 hours of memory. If I use 22 hours to reinforce my strike, I can destroy one of your  spires.”  "}
{"text": "-...Are you threatening us now?  "}
{"text": "“That’s right,” the Constellation Killer affirmed indifferently. “According to my records, you are  someone who cares much for your dignity. Being unable to get rid of me after a total mobilization must  be a painful loss. However, it is nothing compared to losing your spire. Carefully consider my threat.”  "}
{"text": "The Magic Tower Master’s face twisted like a goblin’s.  “For the next week, you are completely forbidden from attacking or scheming against me or this man.  Attacking and scheming includes all acts and incidents that would cause us harm. Both indirect and  "}
{"text": "direct methods are forbidden, and if a subjective judgment is required, the person who decides will be  decided by us. Hence, your subjectivity is not allowed.”  -This shitty pair of swordsmen are...  "}
{"text": "“T’]] threaten you again. Accept this week-long ceasefire.”  The Constellation Killer grabbed his sword.  “If you don’t accept it, [Il tear it down.”  "}
{"text": "The silence settled in the ruined wasteland.  -You... You two are on the Magic Tower's hit list.  "}
{"text": "“Do you agree to the ceasefire?”  A tongue clicked. Simultaneously, a sheet of paper appeared before the Constellation Killer’s eyes. It  "}
{"text": "was a glittering gold contract. The Constellation Killer read the contract with an artless eye and then  pulled out his fountain pen and signed it.  “Tt’s been a satisfactory negotiation. Now, go back.”  "}
{"text": "-I’Il bury you along with the Sword Emperor, Constellation Killer.  “T will not forget to record your enmity.”  -Tsk!  "}
{"text": "The wizards turned their brooms. Like a swarm of locusts in the fall, they populated the sky and slowly  drove away.  "}
{"text": "Our surroundings became quiet.  Nobody was around except for the Constellation Killer and myself.  The Constellation Killer turned and looked at me.  "}
{"text": "“T have fulfilled my word to you, stranger.”  “However, by your observation, I am trapped. I won the battle, but as a result, my week-long memory  "}
{"text": "has been reduced to that of a day. I’m currently weak. This weakening of my power would be your  intended goal, of course.”  The Constellation Killer described his situation in a very matter-of-fact way.  "}
{"text": "It was like he was talking in third person.  -Gongja.  Bae Hu-ryeong’s voice became much lower.  "}
{"text": "-Don't overlook it. That guy is trying to stall for as much time as he can by talking to you. Don’t see  him as a human. He’s nothing but a weapon who moves fully according to what he has written.  "}
{"text": "“Yes.”  I gripped the Holy Sword.  "}
{"text": "‘I know.’  Then, I stared at the Constellation Killer.  “You’re right. I will take you down.”  "}
{"text": "“Yet, I cannot attack you according to my promise. I can only defend or evade your attacks... It’s a  dangerous situation. It will be particularly dangerous if you are the Sword Emperor or his  reincarnation, as the Magic Tower Master said.”  "}
{"text": "“My name is Death King. I am the young master of the Demonic Sect and the spouse of the Duchess of  Ivansia.”  "}
{"text": "The Constellation Killer opened his diary and wrote down some words. He must have written down my  name. The Constellation Killer asked me a question while he moved his fountain pen.  “What is the Demonic Sect?”  "}
{"text": "“Tt is a blade that responds to all screams.”  “What is a young master?”  "}
{"text": "“Tt is the first sword to be swung.”  “What is Death King?”  I pulled forth my red aura.  "}
{"text": "“Tt is the name of the person who will kill you.”  This time, I asked a question.  "}
{"text": "“Constellation Killer. Do you have any memories of hunger?”  “Tt is written in the diary. However, as far as the memories in my head, I have none. I have no memory  of hunger.”  "}

{"text": "-What?  Of course, it wasn’t only the Constellations who reacted to the death of the Constellation Killer.  -What? Wait, what... Did the Constellation Killer just die? Really?  "}
{"text": "A dull voice resounded in the gray sky. The chief of the wizards who had just warred against the  Constellation Killer, the so-called Magic Tower Master, was in shock.  "}
{"text": "That voice was only the beginning. People started to flock to the wasteland. One by one, the Hunters  who had fled the battle between the Constellation Killer and the Magic Tower approached.  "}
{"text": "“No way. The Constellation Killer died?”  “Who is that guy?”  “T’ve never heard of the Sword Emperor.”  "}
{"text": "“Fuck, that crazy mofo bastard was reincarnated...”  Though they were shocked, they did not rush and pile on top of me. There was an alertness in their  "}
{"text": "eyes. They were wary of a newcomer who had suddenly hunted the Constellation Killer.  ‘It’s dangerous. I should disappear before I draw more attention.’  I caught my breath, which had become feverish during my fight with the Constellation Killer.  "}
{"text": "‘If they discover that my fighting prowess is less than they think, I don’t know when or how they’ Il  attack.’  "}
{"text": "I was only able to hunt the Constellation Killer through a trap. If we were both fully prepared, I would  have lost 100 percent no matter how many times we fought. The other Hunters weren’t aware of this  fact yet... It was really lucky that they weren’t.  "}
{"text": "‘I should hurry.’  I put the Constellation Killer’s body on my back and muttered, “Transmit.”  "}
{"text": "In my mind, I was already thinking of the Great Library’s majestic lobby. Soon, my body would be  transmitted there, carrying the Constellation Killer’s corpse. Then, I would coax [The Corner Librarian]  to follow my schemes.  "}
{"text": "However, nothing happened.  “Transmit.”  "}
{"text": "I muttered again, but it was the same. I remained in the desolate field. The glutenous blood from the  Constellation Killer’s corpse soaked my back. Hundreds of Hunters stared at me in confusion.  "}
{"text": "Suddenly, an ominous premonition swept over me.  “The stage clear announcement hasn’t been made yet!’  The Constellation Killer was unmistakably dead. And yet, no voice declared to me that [the stage has  "}
{"text": "been cleared].  “Why? Was something lacking?’  "}
{"text": "I desperately tried to think of what happened. Was it not enough to kill the Constellation Killer? Was  the Tower refusing to recognize the 50th floor as cleared since the Constellation Killer wasn’t the  master of the 50th floor?  "}
{"text": "“ ..Why’s he like that? He’s just standing still.”  “Hold on, my observation skill says that guy’s level is only B-Class.”  “B-Class?”  "}
{"text": "While I was urgently thinking, the Hunters began to murmur. The air of astonishment ebbed away.  Astonishment slowly turned into alertness, and alertness soon became suspicion.  "}
{"text": "“Don’t joke.”  “Well, he must have a camouflage skill. The Constellation Killer is at least S-Class, so there’s no way  he’d die to a B-Class.”  "}
{"text": "“Hey! Somebody talk to him!”  “Are there any Hunters who were active when the Sword Emperor was alive?”  "}
{"text": "I broke out in a cold sweat.  ‘This isn’t good.’  "}
{"text": "Uneasiness rippled through the air. It wasn’t just because I could see the Hunters sniffing about. It  wasn’t because each of those Hunters was a higher level than me and thus dangerous.  The sense that I’d [missed something].  "}
{"text": "A Hunter’s intuition.  "}
{"text": "Next to me, Bae Hu-ryeong was smirking.  -What’re you looking at?  "}
{"text": "‘Speak honestly. You know something, don’t you?’  -I don’t know what you mean. I already gave you all the advice I’Il give.  "}
{"text": "Saying so, Bae Hu-ryeong grinned. The corners of his mouth were filled with mischief. Shit. Cursing in  my mind, I recalled the advice he gave me.  [ Gongja. J  "}
{"text": "[Don’t see him as a human. He’s nothing but a weapon that moves fully according to what he has  written. |  "}
{"text": "Not a human but a weapon. A fighting machine.  ‘What would I do if I was Lefanta Aegim? He’s a man who calculates everything obsessively. Wouldn’t  "}
{"text": "he naturally have plans for if he died?’  My thinking became quicker.  ‘Furthermore, Bae Hu-ryeong has met the Constellation Killer before.’  "}
{"text": "I saw Lefanta Aegim’s face for the first time in a trauma. Bae Hu-ryeong was with me then, too. He had  immediately recognized Lefanta Aegim’s identity.  "}
{"text": "[It feels like I’ve seen that bastard before? J  [Even at a glance, I can recognize that he’s definitely the Constellation Killer.

{"text": "[ What else could our relationship be? We had a proper fight. }  [ He was strong, I’ll give him that, but he couldn’t dare match me. ]  In other words...  ‘Bae Hu-ryeong beat the Constellation Killer in battle.’  The Constellation Killer had been defeated by Bae Hu-ryeong before.  "}
{"text": "Then, wasn’t it too strange?  Feeling the Constellation Killer’s blood drip down my spine, I looked at Bae Hu-ryeong.  “You...”  -Yeah.  “There is no way a person like you would spare the Constellation Killer.’  "}
{"text": "The Sword Emperor.  He was a crazy nutjob, but he had a noble attitude when it came to swords and martial arts.  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong killed my master. He killed her in a fair match. Master was beautiful, and she was as  kind as she was beautiful. Bae Hu-ryeong recognized it, saying that [this was the doctrine of the  Demonic Cult], and cut her.  "}
{"text": "-Heh.  The Constellation Killer was depraved. He couldn’t even be compared to my master.  -Smart little brat.  "}
{"text": "After subduing the Constellation Killer... there was no way that Bae Hu-ryeong wouldn’t have killed  him.  "}
{"text": "-This is why I like you. You have to be smart to be a Hunter. There are three qualities a Hunter needs.  Intelligence, to plan a way to win. Courage, to execute the plan. Skill, to succeed in the execution. You  have to be smart, adaptive, and competent.  "}
{"text": "There was only one conclusion.  Bae Hu-ryeong must have killed the Constellation Killer in the past.  Only, that wasn’t the end.  "}
{"text": "-The Constellation Killer bastard is a Hunter, Gongja, just like you.  The sky split.  "}
{"text": "“Strengthening one blow.”  I.  “—] throw away the white flower I saw when I looked down on my way here.”  "}
{"text": "I was only able to avoid the blow because I was extremely tense and wary of my surroundings. I had  reinforced my vision and hearing, all five senses, with my aura as much as I could. As I keenly  observed the flow of air, I felt a blade that tore the flow apart.  "}
{"text": "I hit the ground.  "}
{"text": "I discarded Lefanta Aegim’s corpse. I disregarded my posture. I fiercely rolled away, my sole aim to get  out of that spot. Running Wave. Any martial artist would laugh at my technique, but I used it with not a  single inkling of shame.  "}
{"text": "In exchange, I survived.  Kwaaaang!  The wasteland was completely uprooted. The ground broke. The sudden blow had waylaid even the  "}
{"text": "crowd who had gathered to look at me. Unlike me, not all of them had been paying attention. Over  twenty Hunters died due to this bit of carelessness.  It happened in an instant.  "}
{"text": "“On the way, I saw an old man planting something in a flower pot.”  "}
{"text": "Someone took a step. Thud. The man’s footsteps echoed in the dense wasteland of screams and groans.  “The flowerpot was small. Petite.

{"text": "times in three battles against the Sword Emperor.”  The silver-haired man scanned the old notebook with his blue eyes.  "}
{"text": "“From my judgment.”  Then, he looked at me.  "}
{"text": "“You avoided two of my blows. But if you were a fighter on the Sword Emperor’s level, you would  have counterattacked immediately after dodging. The Sword Emperor said his level of martial arts was  called the Dawn Circle Sword. Your skills are not on that level.”  "}

{"text": "The Constellation Killer was another person who had measures against death.  “T judge that you are a dangerous person whom I cannot leave alone. I will neutralize you  immediately.”  "}
{"text": "The Constellation Killer pulled a yellow rubber band from his chest pocket. Slowly, he tied his silver  hair.  "}
{"text": "“Our fight begins now.”  The world fractured.  "}
{"text": "-Come on, Gongja.  Bae Hu-ryeong laughed loudly.  The slightly frayed sleeves of a robe fluttered.  "}
{"text": "-This is the world after the 50th floor!  4.  "}
{"text": "I pulled forth my red aura with all my strength.  “Dammit! A doll? You’re really no different from a machine, are you?!”  "}
{"text": "“In my battles against the Sword Emperor, there were no witnesses except for one Constellation.”  The Constellation Killer looked between me and his diary. It would be nice if looking was all he did.  He continued to rain down blows without pause. I did my best to avoid his repeated attacks.  "}
{"text": "“Tt was because the Sword Emperor considered the duel to be sacred. The Sword Emperor called it a  martial arts contest. However, too many have witnessed this death. It will be difficult to eliminate all  witnesses.”  "}
{"text": "-This crazy bastard...  "}
{"text": "I heard a voice muttering absently in the faraway sky. It was the voice of the Magic Tower Master.  Regardless, the Constellation Killer continued to calculate how to act next.  “Therefore, I will threaten them instead of killing them. Listen. Look. To those who oppose me and to  "}
{"text": "those who will oppose me in the future, I have artificially acquired immortality. Even if you kill me, I  will stand before you again.”  “And I vow to kill the person who has killed me. If a group worked together to kill me, I will destroy  "}

{"text": "I narrowly managed to avoid the Constellation Killer’s attack. The attack I dodged did not cut me but  [the Constellation Killer’s corpse].

{"text": "“My declaration is not just a threat. I will kill you here to prove it.”  His face was still expressionless.  It was like he placed no value on his own body.  "}
{"text": "“Strengthening one blow.”  The Constellation Killer dashed at me.  "}
{"text": "“T abandon all the beauty of the world.”  ‘Ah.’  I had been under the illusion that time had stopped.  "}
{"text": "As a wave of air from his sword strike ripped through the earth, I looked the Constellation Killer in the  eyes. They were apathetic.  "}
{"text": "Pure madness.  His eyes were not afraid of any sacrifice or price he had to pay in order to act on his convictions. Yes,  "}
{"text": "Bae Hu-ryeong was right. This man was a person who lived as a hunter just like I did.  ‘It’s me.’  "}
{"text": "I lamented.  ‘It’s me if I didn’t meet Raviel—‘  "}
{"text": "Staring at my imminent death, in that moment, I gave up on defending. I ignored it. But I wasn’t just  throwing away my life.  "}
{"text": "[Don’t kill yourself without my permission. ]  [Don’t die even when there’s an easy escape. ]  [Even if you don’t think you can escape death, struggle until the end. J  "}
{"text": "As I gave up on defense, I swung my sword. If I couldn’t block the blow anyway, even if I was going to  die, I could at least hit him properly. That was just who I was. That was the promise I made with  Raviel.  "}
{"text": "Chwaak!  My sword collided with the Constellation Killer’s strike.  My blade cut open the diary in the Constellation Killer’s left hand.  "}
{"text": "I saw the Constellation Killer’s silver eyebrows twitch.  “ ”  "}
{"text": "His blow had pierced me.  ‘T admit it.’  "}
{"text": "I coughed. Blood poured back down my throat. My vision turned white. Even as my body boiled, I  glared at the Constellation Killer until the very end.  "}

{"text": "[The Corner Librarian rejoices but also despairs.]  I will beat you.  "}
{"text": "[You have died. ]  Just wait.  [Currently, your Hunter rank is B-Class. ]  "}

{"text": "[The penalty is the animal road. ][1]  My consciousness drifted away.  "}
{"text": "From a faraway world, like it was crossing nirvana, there was a melody.  Ding,  Dong,  "}
{"text": "Dang,  Dong.  Somehow, the tune sounded very familiar.  "}
{"text": "It was the sound of a bell I think I heard a long time ago.  “Where did I hear this... Oh? Where... Where was it?’  "}
{"text": "I tried to open my eyes. My eyelids felt like they were being weighed down with iron. My whole body  was tingling with sleep paralysis. Only the unclear melody, the hazy bells, could be heard.  "}
{"text": "Ding, dong, dang, dong...  At some point, I could hear another sound.  -This is the broadcasting department, notifying all students remaining on school grounds...  "}
{"text": "School?  -Other than the students who will participate in nighttime self-study, everyone, please go home now.  Once again, the broadcasting department announces...  "}
{"text": "Go home.  "}
{"text": "-Recently, some students have remained on school grounds after dismissal time has passed. To the  students at school now, please return home if you have not applied for nighttime self-study.  Ding, dong, dang, dong.  "}
{"text": "The bell rang again, and the voice stopped speaking.  What the hell was this?  "}
{"text": "I struggled to break free of the sleep paralysis. But struggling was no use, so I concentrated my  consciousness on one point as much as I could. I felt my body fidget. As I was trying to move my  fingers by concentrating a bit more, something hit my head.  "}
{"text": "“Sunbae, wake up! We’ve been dismissed!”  Only then could I move, like I had been released from binding magic. I exhaled violently. Gradually, I  "}

{"text": "“Tt’s not good for you to sleep on your desk! It’s bad for your back, and more importantly, you won’t  sleep well. I understand that you’re studying hard since it’s almost midterms, but please go home and  sleep instead!”  "}
{"text": "The Heretic Questioner was smiling down at me.  However, something was different.  "}
{"text": "“’.. Heretic Questioner?”  The Heretic Questioner was wearing a school uniform.  "}
{"text": "“What? A heretic questioner?”  He tilted his head side to side.  “Who’s that?”  "}
{"text": "“ ..Maybe... Are you the Golden Silk? Were you possessed by the Heretic Questioner again?”  “Possessed? Ah. Did you have a dream? Ahaha. Sunbae, you read a lot of books. You must have had an  "}

{"text": "The two of us were at... a library. But even though it was a library, it was shabby when compared to  the Great Library of All Things. If the Great Library was a magnificent chateau, this was a cramped  kennel.  "}
{"text": "Looking out the window, I could see a wide schoolyard.  Like a normal school.  ‘Sword Emperor.’  "}
{"text": "Feeling my mouth go dry, I muttered in my head.  “There’s trouble, Sword Emperor. This. I think the penalties became totally weird as my level went up.  "}
{"text": "Before, I saw the trauma like I was peeping in a dream, but this... Sword Emperor?’  There was no response.  I looked around again.  "}
